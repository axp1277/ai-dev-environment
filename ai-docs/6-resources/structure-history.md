# ai-docs Structure History

## Current Layout (v2)
- Introduced central `1-prompts/` directory with `core/`, `roles/`, and `utilities/` subfolders.
- Moved workflows to `2-workflows/` and co-located specs, PRDs, and meeting notes at `3-`, `4-`, and `5-` prefixes respectively.
- Archived the former `agents/` and `6-tools/playbooks/` directories by merging their content into the prompts tree.
- Reserved `6-resources/` for background material and notes like this file.

## Legacy References
Older brainstorming transcripts may still mention the previous layout (e.g., `1-prds/`, `2-specs/`, `4-prompts/`). Keep this in mind when reviewing historical material and prioritise the updated paths above when generating new documents.
