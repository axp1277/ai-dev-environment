# Resources Index

Use this folder for reference material that supports prompts and workflows without acting as prompts themselves. Examples include:

- Historical decisions, architecture notes, or integration guides
- Troubleshooting tips and operational checklists not already captured as utility prompts
- Links to external assets or standards relevant to the project

When adding new resources, cross-link them from the relevant prompt or workflow so assistants can discover supporting context quickly.
