“Okay, so are you ready to hear about the new enhancement?”

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I'm all ears! It sounds like you've got a neat enhancement idea to build on top of your brain-to-specs workflow. Feel free to dive right in and share the details!

You said:
“So I need another workflow. This workflow starts with a Google Meet between myself, the developer, and a client.”

ChatGPT said:
Got it! So we're

“Okay, once the Google Transcript is completed, the transcript gets sent to me.”

Absolutely, that makes

“The transcript of the...”

ChatGPT said:
Gotcha, so the idea is that once that Google Meet wraps up, you’ll automatically get the transcript sent over to you. That makes sense and fits nicely with the kind of workflows you’ve been building—basically capturing that conversation so you can use it as a basis for specs. Let’s definitely build that into the new workflow.

You said:
“So, it's a little bit different because we're not going to create a specification document. We're actually going to create a... We're going to generate multiple files based on the following, okay? Now, listen carefully because this is important. So, the first thing is we're going to actually have a... I have two system prompts, one called Bugs and one called Feature, okay? So, the first thing that needs to be done is we need to tell the AI to identify in the conversation in the meeting which elements, which portions are Bugs and which portions are Features, okay? Does that make sense so far?”
00:55
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So basically, once the transcript is in your hands, the AI will sort through that meeting conversation and classify which parts are about bugs and which parts are about new features. And then from that classification, you’ll generate multiple files accordingly—one for the bug-related notes and one for the feature-related notes, each based on its own system prompt. Totally clear so far!

All right, that sounds like a really neat and organized flow. So essentially, we're creating a workflow that takes a client-developer meeting transcript, splits it into bugs and features, and then outputs each of those into neatly categorized markdown files.

As for a name, we could go for something like "Meet-to-Issues" or "Meeting Insight Classifier," or even just "BugFeatureExtractor." It’s a bit of a mouthful, but it captures exactly what it’s doing! Let me know if any of those resonate or if you want to brainstorm a bit more on the naming!

You said:
“So we got to come up with a good name for that, because you're basically doing is you're taking a meeting, right, and then you are extracting bugs and features. So what is a good term that encompasses both?”
00:14
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, absolutely. We definitely want a name that neatly captures both sides of that process. So maybe something like "IssueExtractor" or "MeetInsightSplitter" could work. Or we could go with something like "BugFeature Digest," if you want a slightly more descriptive term. It's basically a tool that splits a meeting transcript into bugs and features, so any name that hints at extracting issues from a meeting could fit. Let me know if any of those spark an idea!

You said:
“Yeah, let's do that. Okay, so your job is to basically direct an AI planner or to basically plan this workflow. Well, actually plan. This is going to be a brainstorming conversation. We're going to hand this off to an AI planner. The AI planner then will take this, split it up into a specification document, and create a specification document with vision, objectives, atomic, and subatomic tasks. And then this will be handed off to an AI coder, and the AI coder will go ahead and actually create the system prompts. And the system prompt that the AI coder will be focusing on is this meet2issues.md file, which will actually become a cloud command. So it should be actually saved in the .cloud forward slash commands folder.”

Perfect, I’ve got the whole flow in mind now! So we’ll treat this as a brainstorming session to lay out the concept. Then the AI planner will jump in and turn all these ideas into a detailed spec with the vision, objectives, and tasks. Finally, the AI coder will take that spec and produce the meet-to-issues.md system prompt, which will live in your .claude/commands folder as a

“Thank you.”

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! So we've got a clear plan here. We'll treat this as a brainstorming conversation to outline the whole "Meet-to-Issues" workflow. Then the AI planner will take over and turn everything into a detailed spec with all those visions, objectives, and tasks. After that, the AI coder will jump in and create the meet-to-issues.md system prompt as a new Claude command in the .claude/commands folder.

So we’ve got a good naming idea, a clear workflow, and a plan for how to hand it off to the AI planner and coder. Let’s do it!

You said:
“Okay, well, go ahead and create a very detailed summary of everything we've talked about, the entire workflow from start to end, so we have a very clear objective of what needs to be done. So this system prompt, which is actually a cloud command, which will be saved under the .cloud forward slash commands subdirectory, is called a higher order prompt, HOP. Higher order prompt just means that it's a prompt that's actually going to call other prompts within. The other prompts within are the slash bug command with a bug description and a slash features command with a features description, right? So the job, though, for the prompt, the system prompt, when the prompt gets created from the meeting transcript, it needs to basically list all the features that need to be implemented. For each feature, it's going to have a forward slash feature and then a feature name, sorry, the feature description, right? And that's going to be a command that the coder is going to execute, the AI coder. And it's going to do the same thing for bugs, forward slash bug, and then the bug description. We could have one or more features and one or more bugs. So each command gets basically specified on a separate line item. So then the AI coder will know that it's going to have to go and execute every single one of these in order to complete that system prompt requirement. Does that make sense?”

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes total sense. So let me sum it all up in detail so we have a really clear picture.

Detailed Summary of the "Meet-to-Issues" Workflow
1. Overview and Goal

We're creating a higher-order prompt (HOP) that will take a Google Meet transcript of a client-developer discussion and identify which parts of the conversation are about bugs and which are about features. The goal is to automatically generate markdown files for each identified bug and feature and save them into their respective folders. This workflow will eventually become a Claude command saved under .claude/commands.

2. Classification and Commands

Once the transcript is processed, the AI will classify portions of the conversation into "bugs" and "features." For each identified bug, we’ll generate a line with the command /bug followed by the bug description. Similarly, for each feature, we’ll generate a /feature command with the feature description. There may be multiple bugs and multiple features, and each one will get its own line.

3. Output and File Structure

The AI coder will take this specification and implement the system prompt. This system prompt will produce markdown files for each bug and feature. Bugs will be saved into ai-docs/2-bugs/, and features into ai-docs/2-features/, with filenames based on the descriptions.

4. Higher-Order Prompt (HOP)

This "Meet-to-Issues" workflow is essentially a higher-order prompt because it will trigger other prompts. It will list all the /bug and /feature commands, and the AI coder will know to execute each one. In other words, the final system prompt will serve as a master command that orchestrates these sub-commands.

In short, the whole process will start with this brainstorm and then move through the planner and coder to produce a neat, command-driven workflow that sorts out your meeting transcript into actionable bug and feature files. Let me know if that all sounds good or if you need any tweaks!

“Yeah, this is good. So, finally, just take this, do a final summary for the AI Planner. But in this particular case, provide some guidelines to the AI Planner on how to set up the tasking. Okay? So, you know, we want to start with, you know, just provide the AI Planner how to split up the task so that it knows exactly what is the best way to split up the task. And then the AI Planner will take over and implement the detailed specification document following a very formal guideline in order to do this.”

Absolutely, I’ll add in some guidelines for the AI planner on how to break it all down.

Final Summary and Guidelines for the AI Planner
Objective:
We are creating a "Meet-to-Issues" workflow that will take a Google Meet transcript and classify parts of the conversation as either "bugs" or "features." Each bug and feature will be turned into a command and then saved as markdown files in the appropriate folders. The final output will be a higher-order prompt (HOP) that orchestrates these commands.

Guidelines for the AI Planner:

Start with a Clear Vision and Objectives:
Begin the specification document by clearly stating the vision: to automate the extraction of bugs and features from a meeting transcript. The objective is to produce a command-driven workflow that outputs markdown files for each classified item.

Define the Main Steps:

Input Phase: The workflow starts by ingesting a Google Meet transcript.

Classification Phase: The AI identifies and separates segments into bugs and features.

Command Generation Phase: For each identified item, generate a /bug or /feature command line with the corresponding description.

Output Phase: Save each bug description markdown file into ai-docs/2-bugs/ and each feature markdown file into ai-docs/2-features/.

Break Down into Atomic and Subatomic Tasks:

Task 1: Implement the logic to read and parse the meeting transcript.

Task 2: Define a classification routine that uses the "bug" and "feature" system prompts to identify and categorize sections of the transcript.

Task 3: Generate the command lines for each bug and feature identified.

Task 4: Create and save markdown files in their respective folders based on the command output.

Task 5: Ensure that the final system prompt (meet-to-issues.md) is saved as a Claude command in .claude/commands/.

Structure the Spec Document:
Provide the planner with a template to structure the specification document:

Introduction: Vision and objectives.

Main Steps: High-level overview of the phases.

Detailed Tasks: Atomic and subatomic tasks listed in order.

Output Requirements: How the final prompt and markdown files should be formatted and stored.

Maintain Formality and Clarity:
Instruct the planner to follow a formal, clear structure to make it easy for the AI coder to understand and implement.
