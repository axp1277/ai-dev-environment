# Utility Prompt: Review a Specification Task

## Purpose
Understand a specific task within a specification and outline viable implementation approaches before coding begins.

## Inputs
- Specification document: `ai-docs/3-specs/specs<spec_number>.md`
- Target task identifier (e.g., `Task 3.0`)

## Steps
1. Locate the requested task and confirm its context within the specification hierarchy.
2. Summarise the task to demonstrate understanding of objectives and dependencies.
3. Propose three implementation options, outlining approaches, required technologies, complexity, advantages, and drawbacks.
4. Recommend one option and justify the selection.
5. Provide high-level implementation steps for the recommended approach.
6. If the task is missing, state so explicitly and suggest how to resolve the mismatch.

## Output
- Analysis outlining task comprehension, three options, the recommended path, and suggested next steps.
