Absolutely, I'm all set! Let's dive in and brainstorm away. Just let me know what we're focusing on this time, and we'll get the ideas flowing.

You said:
“All right, so I have been involved in many different programs where I've been building these agent architecture frameworks using LandGraphs mostly, where I can build agents, share files, shared memory agents, and stitch them together using LandGraph's state machine capabilities. And I need to brainstorm on a way to basically have a more agnostic way of creating these agents. An agent will always have a system prompt associated to it, a model associated to it, context, and a set of tools. So I just need help with being able to come up with this agnostic framework where I can basically build agents on demand and store all these different files in a very specific way.”

ChatGPT said:

Got it! So we're looking to create a kind of "agent-agnostic" blueprint that lets you spin up these agents on demand, each with their own system prompt, model, and tools, but all organized in a clean, reusable way. Absolutely up my alley.

So to kick things off, here's a high-level idea: we can think of having a modular directory structure where each agent is essentially a configuration plus a toolkit. For example, you have a base folder for all agents, and each agent has its own subfolder with a YAML or JSON config file that defines its system prompt, which model it uses, and which tools are attached.

Then, we can have a shared folder for the tools—these tools are just Python modules or scripts that any agent can import. The idea is to keep it DRY and modular: if you add a new tool, any agent can reference it without duplicating code.

Finally, we could have a central registry or index file that just keeps track of all the agents you've defined. That way, you can dynamically load them up as needed. So in other words, you'd have a framework where adding a new agent is as simple as dropping in a new config file and telling it which model and tools to use.

If that sounds like the right direction, we can dive into more details and really flesh it out. Let me know what you think!

You said:
“Okay, so actually, I don't think I want to go that route, and I'll explain why. I think we have to make it a little bit more modular, or less files. Okay, so hear me out for a second. What if we had a folder, inside this folder, we had pyfiles, okay? And the folder name was agents. So every agent gets its own single file python file. Okay, so we could have a single file agent, okay, where”
00:38
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense.

You said:
“The benefit of doing it this way is that you can import that one agent and just use it without any other agents, without having to stitch up any other agent or any other dependency. So that agent has a system prompt, and a system prompt would be stored inside of the agent. It would have a model, it would have context as input, structured output, so it would be all kind of self-contained in one file. So I can literally run this one single file and kick the agents off. Now, the benefit of this is by using LandGraph, if we do need to, for example, create a network, we could have another folder called multi-agents, and then inside of that we would have single files that would represent networks of agents. So here, what we're doing is we're importing the single file agents and we're stitching them together. In this case, we're actually going to have shared memory, potentially, shared context, we're going to be passing inputs and outputs between the agents, and so forth. This is the type of architecture that I was thinking about. What are your thoughts on this?”

ChatGPT said:

I think that’s a really elegant approach! It definitely simplifies things by keeping each agent self-contained in a single file. That way, you can just drop in a new Python file for each agent, and it's immediately runnable and importable without having to manage a bunch of external dependencies or configurations.

And I like the idea of having a separate multi_agents folder for networks of agents. That way, when you need a more complex workflow where agents interact and share context, you just define that in another single Python file that imports the individual agents. That gives you the flexibility to have both standalone agents and orchestrated multi-agent workflows without over-engineering it.

So I think it’s a great plan. It’s minimal, it’s modular, and it definitely fits with the idea of keeping everything clean and DRY. Let’s roll with it!

You said:
“And we can use LandGraph, and the idea of using LandGraph is because, you know, I know that LandGraph could be an overkill for a single agent because it's more tuned for orchestrating multi-agent systems. But the beauty of that is we can have these single file agents act as single file agents, but we could also bring them into an orchestrated file.”
00:25
ChatGPT said:

Exactly, that’s a perfect way to look at it. With LangGraph, you get that flexibility where you can go as simple or as complex as you need. So each single-file agent can just run on its own if that’s all you need, or you can easily pull them into a larger orchestrated network when you want that multi-agent interaction.

So yeah, I think this is a great approach. You get the best of both worlds: simplicity for individual agents and the power of LangGraph for when you want to scale up to something more orchestrated. Let’s go ahead and shape it that way!

You said:
“Okay, so now you have to think about another facet here because these agents, as I said, they're composed of a system prompt, a predefined structured output, if possible, using maybe a pedantic type structure. Context would be something that they would get from the outside world environment inputs, and then they could also potentially have shared memory. And the best way to kind of maintain shared memory is an agent has its own shared memory space, and you could basically just keep track of, just use the native LandGraph capability and storing memory. I think LandGraph has a very simple way of doing it by using dictionaries. But then we have tools, and tools are not really part of any single file agent. Tools I see as a separate folder where we could have, in my opinion, the way we should implement tools is we would have a tools folder, and then within the tools folder we would have a subfolder for each tool, and then each tool is built in a way that it can be used as a CLI. So the agent, when it's invoking the tool, it automatically knows how to invoke the tool and how to use it, and that's the beauty of just having a command line interface for each tool. What do you think of this architecture?”
01:44
ChatGPT said:

I think that's a really smart way to structure it. It definitely keeps the tools nicely decoupled from the agents themselves, which means each tool is kind of a standalone utility. And by making each tool invocable as a CLI, you're giving agents a really simple interface. They just need to know how to call that command line tool, pass the right parameters, and they get what they need back.

So in essence, you're building a really clean separation of concerns. Agents live in their own files, they have their prompts, their models, and their memory, and then they just reach out to these independent CLI-based tools when they need some external functionality. And if you ever need to update a tool or add a new one, it doesn't mess with the agents themselves.

Overall, I think this architecture is really solid. It’s modular, it's clean, and it's definitely going to be easy to maintain and extend. Let's go for it!

You said:
“All right, so why don't you just summarize the entire architecture for me. Obviously, all of this would basically be self-contained in an SRC folder, right? So, as we said, we would have an agents folder where we have these single file agents. We would have a folder for orchestrating agents. Maybe, I don't know what you want to call them. You want to call them multi-agent systems. Yeah, maybe a folder called multi-agent systems. And then, in there, we would have networks, right? And, you know, we could have independent files for each network, but there's nothing preventing us from basically having a network that uses other networks or sub-networks. But, you see what I'm getting to?”
00:54
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I see exactly what you're getting at, and let me summarize the whole architecture in a nice clean package.

So yes, everything is going to live under one main src folder. Inside that, you'll have an agents directory. Each agent is a single Python file, totally self-contained, with its own system prompt, model, and predefined structure. It can handle inputs, context, and even its own memory, all in that one file. So if you want to run a single agent, you just import that file and you're good to go.

Then you'll have another directory, let's call it multi_agent_systems or something along those lines. In there, each file represents a network of agents. You can think of it as an orchestrated LangGraph setup where you're stitching multiple agents together. And like you said, you can even have networks that use other networks, kind of like sub-networks, for more complex workflows.

Finally, you have a tools directory. Each tool is in its own subfolder and is designed to be used as a command-line interface. So the agents just call these tools whenever they need extra functionality, and it keeps everything super modular and reusable.

So that’s the big picture: one src folder, agents in their own files, multi-agent networks in another folder, and tools as CLI utilities. That should give you a nice, clean, and flexible architecture.

You said:
“All right, perfect. And then I think the other thing that we need is, we need to, unless LandGraph has this kind of built-in capability already, but sometimes models, like, do you think we should have an interface for the models? Or you think we should just use, I think we should just use the built-in LandGraph model interface, right? Because if you think about it, right, like, you could specify a model. I think the model itself should be specified inside of the single-agent file, OK? The system prompt as well, it should really be specified inside of the single-agent file. Would you agree?”
00:45
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I think that makes a lot of sense. Keeping the model specification right inside the single agent file is definitely the way to go for simplicity. And yes, LangGraph does have its own way of handling models, so you can definitely leverage that built-in interface rather than reinventing the wheel.

So to sum that up: each agent file will include its own model definition and its own system prompt right there in the code. That keeps everything self-contained and easy to understand. You just open up one agent file and you see exactly which model it's using, what the system prompt is, and how it's structured.

In short, I think you're spot on. We can rely on LangGraph's model handling and keep everything neatly packaged inside each agent file. It’s all about keeping it simple and self-contained, and that definitely aligns with what you're going for.

You said:
“Yeah, so then the other thing that I wanted to mention is, I think each file, each single file agent, should have its own CLI tool. Meaning, I should be able to run this agent, or any agent, from the command line, using CLICK maybe, and provide it any inputs. I should also be able to just run the file itself, and it would just basically call a default main. If I were to just run this file with no inputs, it would still have to work somehow.”
00:33
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, and that's a really nice touch. So basically each agent file can double as a command-line tool on its own. Using something like Click is a great idea, because it’ll let you easily define command-line arguments and options for each agent. And if you just run the agent file with no arguments, it can have a default mode or a default main function that it falls back to. That makes each agent super flexible—you can run it directly from the command line for quick testing or integrate it into a larger system.

So just to round it all up: every single-file agent will have its model, system prompt, and logic inside. It'll also have a CLI interface using Click, so you can run it from the command line with or without arguments. If you don’t pass any inputs, it’ll just run in a default mode. That gives you maximum flexibility and a really user-friendly way to interact with each agent. I think that’s a fantastic addition!

You said:
“Okay, perfect. And then, finally, I think, you know, it would be great if we could just have a way to, you know, like, we should be able to just basically copy any of these agent files into any other directory, and they should just work right out of the box, because they're just single file agents. Obviously, if you copy a network of agents, you're going to have to also copy the other agents as well inside of the single file agent folder. But the point is that PythonUV by Astro has a way to actually run these py files using built-in dependencies inside the file itself. I don't know if that's really necessary, though, because we're always going to be running it within a Python environment. So I guess I take that back. But we do need to have the awareness that PythonUV has the ability to basically import or just run a py file without having to create a Python environment.”
01:13
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, I totally get what you’re saying, and that makes perfect sense. The beauty of the single-file agent approach is that you can just drop any of these agent files into another directory and they’re good to go, as long as you have the basic dependencies installed in your Python environment.

And yeah, Python-uv by Astral is a pretty neat tool that can bundle dependencies inside a single file if you ever need that kind of portability. But if you’re always running in a standard Python environment, you probably don’t need to overcomplicate it.

In short, you’ve got it exactly right: these agents are super portable. You can copy them anywhere, and they’ll just work. And if you ever do need that extra layer of portability, there are tools out there that can help. But it sounds like you’ve got a really clean and flexible architecture now, and I think it’s going to work great!

You said:
“All right, perfect. Can you just do a very detailed overview of everything we've talked about so far? This is basically going to be provided to an AI planner. The AI planner will take our detailed guidelines and create a very specific specification file with subatomic tasks. The spec file will then be handed off to an AI coder. The AI coder will implement the file from start to end.”

Detailed Overview of the Agent Architecture

Project Structure and Philosophy

We're designing a framework to create single-file, self-contained agents that can be run individually or orchestrated together. Each agent is a single Python file living in an src/agents directory. The entire architecture is modular, minimalistic, and easy to maintain.

Agent Design (Single-File Agents)

Self-Contained Files: Each agent is one Python file that includes everything it needs: its system prompt, model specification, and logic. This makes each agent portable and easy to drop into any directory.

Model and System Prompt: Inside each agent file, you define the model and system prompt right there. We rely on LangGraph’s built-in model interface, so each agent specifies which model it uses directly in its code.

CLI Interface: Every agent doubles as a command-line tool. We’ll use Click (or a similar library) to allow the agent to be run from the command line. If you run the file with no inputs, it’ll have a default behavior, but you can also provide command-line arguments to customize its run.

Multi-Agent Systems

Orchestration Folder: We have a separate multi_agent_systems folder where we define networks of agents. Each file in this directory represents an orchestrated setup of multiple agents using LangGraph’s capabilities. You can think of these as "networks" or "sub-networks" that combine multiple agents together.

Reusability: If you move a network, you’ll need to move the individual agents it uses as well. But because each agent is self-contained, that’s just a matter of copying the relevant files.

Tools and Utilities

Separate Tools Folder: There’s a tools directory where each tool is a CLI utility. Agents call these tools as needed. This keeps tools modular and reusable across multiple agents.

Portability and Simplicity

Portability: Each agent file can be copied into any other directory and will run out of the box. As long as you have the required Python environment, no special packaging is needed.

Future Options: While we’re not relying on it, tools like Python-uv by Astral could be used for additional portability if ever needed.

That should cover all the key points! With this summary, your AI planner can break it down into a specification file with atomic and subatomic tasks, and then the AI coder can implement it from start to finish. Let me know if there’s anything else!
