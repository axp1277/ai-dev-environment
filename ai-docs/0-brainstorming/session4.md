“All righty, you ready for a new brainstorming session?”

ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, Andrea! I'm all ears and ready to dive into a new brainstorming session. Just let me know what we're brainstorming about today and we'll get started!

You said:
“All right, so we're going to create a new trading view indicator. This indicator will be a smart way to enable us to automatically compute reward-to-risk mathematical targets and stop-loss and entries based on asset, contract size, and all that. I want to be able to know and visualize how much I am going to be targeting, how much I'm going to be risking, and how does the reward-to-risk change or overall profit change if I were to scale out on the way to the target or scale in on the way to the target at predefined levels. Does that make sense?”
00:48
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, that makes perfect sense, and honestly it sounds like a really neat TradingView indicator. So basically, we're talking about an indicator that’s going to help you visualize your reward-to-risk ratio dynamically. It’ll factor in your contract size, your entry, your stop-loss, and it will kind of show you if you scale in or out at certain levels how that ratio changes.

So yeah, I totally get the concept. We can definitely brainstorm how to lay it out and how to start implementing it.

You said:
“So I already have an initial visual of what the layout should be. We're going to basically have different modes of operation for this indicator. So the first mode of operation is probably the simplest one, where basically we're going to just establish an entry, a stop loss, and a target. And then we'll add additional modes of operation after that. But for now, let's assume that we want to compute the theoretical P&L. If we were to enter at a specific level, exit at a specific level as a target, and place a stop loss at a specific level. And then also, because we're trading futures, it's going to have to factor in the tick value, tick size, and the contract size. Does that make sense?”
01:03
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, and I like the idea of starting with that simple mode first. So basically, we’ll have a kind of foundational mode where you just plug in your entry, your stop-loss, and your target, and the indicator will automatically calculate your theoretical profit and loss based on that. And since we’re dealing with futures, of course, we’ll bring in the tick size, tick value, and contract size so that all the math lines up correctly. So yeah, that’s a solid first step, and then we can always add those extra layers of complexity like scaling in and out once we have that core in place.

You said:
“Perfect. So, let me explain to you how we're going to do this because there are actually very specific requirements to what I want to add as inputs, and there's different ways to add inputs into our strategy. So, the first one is, as I said, we're going to specify a stop loss, an entry price, a target price, and a stop loss price. So, again, what I'm envisioning is potentially having different modules in NinjaTrader in the input, like groups. You know how you can have groups when you're specifying user inputs in your settings? So, this specific group would be a group that would be either enabled or disabled. And if the group is enabled, then this specific group is basing your entry, your target, and your stop loss by specifying three different price levels. Does that make sense?”
01:07
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, absolutely, that does make sense. So what you're thinking is basically having a dedicated group of inputs—like a section in the settings—that you can enable or disable. And when you enable that group, that’s where you plug in your entry price, your target price, and your stop-loss price all as individual inputs. And then the indicator will read from those levels and do all the calculations based on them.

So yeah, that structure is super clear. We’ll just have this kind of grouped input section in the UI, and when you turn it on, you get those three fields. That definitely gives us a nice clean way to start and then layer on more complexity as we go.

You said:
“Yep, so then the next group that we should have, and actually this should be the very first group, is we are going to define the contract size. Okay, so actually what we should do is we should define the contract size for entry, and then we should also have two additional groups that will define whether, actually no, let's keep it simple, just we'll have the first group as contract size, and then after that we're going to have a group for the standard stop-loss entry and target, given the price levels.”
00:39
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that sounds like a good plan. So we'll set it up so that the very first group of inputs will let you define your contract size. And that way, you can specify exactly how many contracts you're dealing with right off the bat.

And then after that, like you said, we'll have the next group, which is basically the entry, stop-loss, and target based on the price levels. So we kind of have a logical flow. First, you define how big your position is, and then you define where you want to enter and exit in terms of price. And that sets a really nice foundation for the indicator. We can build on top of that later, but this way we have a nice clean

You said:
“All right, let's continue the conversation. Where did we leave off?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:

Sure! We were just talking about setting up the structure for your TradingView indicator. We laid out that the first input group will be for the contract size, so you can define how many contracts you’re dealing with. Then the next group will let you specify the entry, stop-loss, and target prices. And that sets a nice foundation for the indicator before we add more complexity.

So that's where we left off! If you want to dive into the next piece or have any more details to throw in, let’s keep going!

You said:
“All right, so I've had a discussion and I've thought about this quite a bit, so this is how we're going to do it. We're going to have... These are the groups that we're going to have, okay? The first group is the contract size. So the contract size is going to be either based on a fixed contract or it's going to be based on a percentage risk of total capital. Okay, so for example, if the percentage risk of total capital is checked, in fact, what we should do is we should probably just have multiple modules, right? Or maybe a drop down box where we say, okay, if we drop down and we say fixed contract size, right, then we would provide the value of the... Actually, I don't know how to do this in TradingView. I don't think there's a way to provide dynamic inputs in the TradingView settings. Do you know?”
01:21
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, I totally get where you're coming from. So in TradingView, it’s true that the input forms are a bit more static and you can’t really have dynamic inputs that appear or disappear based on a selection. But we can still make it pretty intuitive.

What we can do is use a dropdown, like you said, to choose between modes—like a fixed contract size mode or a percentage-of-capital mode. And then we can just have both sets of inputs there. So if you pick fixed contract size, you’d fill in that input and just ignore the percentage one, and if you pick the percentage-of-capital mode, you’d fill that one in and ignore the other. It's not fully dynamic, but it does give users the flexibility to choose how they want to define the contract size.

So yeah, we can definitely work around that limitation and keep it straightforward. Let’s roll with that!

You said:
“Yeah, I agree. Let's just roll with that. Then, the second mode is a mode of operation. So, in this particular mode, we would... And this is actually a group, okay? So, this would be in another group, and it would say, enable standard reward-to-risk with fixed price values, okay? So, we would specify a target, sorry, an entry, a stop-loss, and a target, okay? And I think the way to do it is, you would first specify the target, because it's the above, then the entry would be the middle, and then the stop-loss price would be below. Actually, let me think about this. Now, let's do entry. Let's do it this way. We would specify... First, we would basically select whether it's a long or short, okay? Then, we would specify the entry, the stop-loss, and the target. And actually, now that I'm thinking about it, we don't even have to specify whether it's long or short, because the way you would specify entry, stop-loss, and target, it should automatically detect whether you're going long or short. Does that make sense?”
01:23
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, that makes total sense. I think that's a really clean approach. So basically, you'd have another group where you're enabling this standard reward-to-risk mode, and you just put in the entry, the stop-loss, and the target prices. And exactly like you said, the indicator can figure out the direction automatically based on whether the target is above or below the entry. So if your target is above your entry, it knows it's a long; if it's below, it knows it's a short. That definitely simplifies the input process.

So yeah, I think you've got a solid plan there. We have the contract size group, and then we have this group for entering the price levels. And the indicator can just do the logic to figure out if it's a long or short. Sounds like a great way forward!

You said:
“All right, perfect. So then, the other thing that I wanted to mention is, what if we... Okay, so then here's the second group. Here's the third group, okay? The third group is going to be defining entries based on fib extensions, okay? And this is how this works. You have to specify a target price, then you have to specify two additional inputs, 0.33% and 0.66%. And what that does is it actually frames two different options for entry. One is 0.66% away from target and one is 0.33% away from target. And then, what we would want to also specify is a reward to risk. And a reward to risk would be set to 2.”
01:08
ChatGPT said:

Got it, that sounds like a cool additional layer. So this third group is basically going to let you set entries based on Fibonacci extensions. And the way you described it makes total sense: you define a target price first, and then you have these two additional levels that are fractions of the distance to the target—like 0.33 and 0.66 away from it.

And then you can just set the reward-to-risk ratio at a default of two, or whatever you want. That way the indicator can automatically calculate those entry points and show you where you might want to enter if you’re using those Fib-based levels.

So yeah, I think that all fits together nicely. You’ve got your contract size group, your straightforward entry-stop-target group, and then this third group for the Fib-based entries. That gives you a lot of flexibility without overcomplicating things.

You said:
“OK, so just want to make 0.66% and 0.33% away, and make those two values that are editable, but default them to 0.66% and 0.33%.”
00:15
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So we can set those 0.66 and 0.33 values as editable inputs, and by default they’ll just be set to those numbers. That way if you want to adjust them to different percentages later on, you can do that. But out of the box, they’ll just be 0.66 and 0.33.

So yeah, that gives you the flexibility to tweak those levels if you need to, and it keeps everything nice and configurable. I think that rounds it out really well!

You said:
“All right, perfect. Okay, then, so far, how many groups do we have?”
00:05
ChatGPT said:

All right, let me just recap the groups we've outlined so far. So first, we have the group for defining the contract size. That's where you can either choose a fixed contract size or a percentage of your total capital. Then second, we have the group where you specify your entry, stop-loss, and target prices, and the indicator will figure out if it's long or short automatically. And then the third group is the one we just talked about, where you define your entries based on those Fibonacci extension levels. And those levels are editable but default to 0.66 and 0.33 of the way to the target.

So in total, we have three groups so far. If we need to add more, we can, but those are the three main ones we've got lined up right now.

You said:
“All right, so then we have a fourth group and this group is called the scale-in and you can enable and disable this by the way And so this group here Basically activates the scale-in And this is what i'm thinking about scale-in Okay, the only input we should need for scale-in is Percent reduction of initial risk Let me explain So when you're scaling into the trade The the biggest the most important factor of a scale-in is that when you scale in you're risking at least no more than the Current initial risk or less. Okay. So what happens is this will give you the ability To compute the scale-in level based on the risk requirement where you can only risk at least The initial risk or less. The beauty about scale-in though is the fact that now you're Potentially increasing your target your reward while risking Average while still risking the same amount of money. Does that make sense?”
01:15
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, and I really like that concept. So basically, this fourth group is all about scaling in. And the key input there is just a percentage that represents how much you want to reduce your initial risk by when you're adding more positions. That way, you can scale in without ever increasing your overall risk beyond that initial amount. And the nice part is, like you said, you get the potential for a greater reward without actually risking more money than you started with.

So yeah, that fits in perfectly as a fourth group. You can enable or disable the scaling in feature, and it’s just got that one key input to set the percentage. That keeps it simple and really effective. I think we’ve got a pretty nice structure now!

You said:
“Now, we do the same for a scale-out, but the way a scale-out works is it's a little bit different. So, for a scale-out, we define a scale-out of at least one R, okay? So, we're going to scale-out when we hit one R, and when we scale-out, we move our stop to break even.”
00:25
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So we’ll have a fifth group for scaling out, and this one will have its own logic. Basically, like you said, you’ll define a scale-out level—let’s say at 1R, so once you’ve made the equivalent of your initial risk in profit, you’ll take some of the position off the table. And at that point, you’ll move your stop-loss up to break-even so the remaining part of your position is basically risk-free.

So it’s kind of a mirror of the scale-in group, just with a different purpose. And you can enable or disable the scale-out group too. That way, once you hit that 1R mark, you’re locking in some profits and making the rest of the trade safer.

I think that’s a great addition and it rounds out the whole indicator nicely.

You said:
“Yeah, so we haven't talked about the visuals, so now we're going to talk about the visuals. Are you ready?”
00:05
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I'm ready to jump into the visuals. We've got all these great groups and logic laid out, so let's talk about how we actually display it all on the chart. Let me know what you're envisioning and we'll make it look as intuitive and helpful as possible.

You said:
“All right, so we're going to draw a rectangular box, okay, where with at least three lines, okay? The two lines are the, sorry, the edges of the box, so the bottom and the top of the box are the stop loss and the target if long, or, you know, depending on whether you're long or short, the entry would be a line, a horizontal line that would split the box. So you could clearly see the two to one, and then the entry line, the target line, and the stop loss line would have the price, the percentage, and the P&L. So obviously at zero, you'd have zero P&L. At the stop loss, you'd have maximum P&L loss, and then at the target, it would show maximum P&L profit. Does that make sense?”
01:01
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, and I really like that visualization idea. So essentially, you're going to have a rectangle on the chart that visually represents the trade. The top and bottom edges of that box will be the target and the stop-loss levels, depending on whether you're long or short. And the entry line is right in the middle, splitting the box so you can easily see that two-to-one ratio.

And yeah, labeling each line with the price, the percentage of the move, and the P&L at that level makes it super clear. So you’ll see zero P&L at the entry, you’ll see your max potential loss at the stop-loss line, and your max profit at the target line. That definitely makes it really intuitive to see exactly what’s going on with the trade at a glance.

So yeah, I think that visualization will be super helpful and ties everything together nicel
