“Are you ready for our next brainstorming conversation?”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I’m all set and ready to dive in whenever you are! Just let me know what we’re brainstorming this time around, and we’ll get rolling.

You said:
“Okay, so here, this is one of the most fundamental challenges that I have when I am working with AI-agentic type coding frameworks. There's Cloud Code, there's Codex, there's different frameworks that are somewhat all, they all kind of somewhat act off of the base principles of, you know, you have a model, you have context, you have a system prompt, you have tools, right? What I want to do is I want to create this universal architecture framework that I can basically plug and play in any other coding-specific agentic framework, and it will work right out of the box. So, meaning, I have my own system prompts, my own ways of doing code review, my own ways of instantiating a project scaffold, my own ways of calling tools, maybe using MCP or maybe just using straight-up CLIs, right? So, I'm trying to come up with this framework that's unified, where I could literally just take this cookie-cutter template, drop it into any project I want, right? And it's ready to go, and any AI, whether any agentic AI that does coding, can reference those documents and understand exactly how to do, what to implement, how to spawn agents, and so forth. You kind of understand my idea here? Because the biggest challenge I have here…”
01:49
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, absolutely, I'm following you. You're basically envisioning this kind of universal "plug-and-play" agentic coding framework that doesn't care which AI coding tool it's working with, right? Whether it's Claude Code or Codex or any other framework, it would just kind of slot right in. You'd have your own system prompts, your own ways of doing things like scaffolding a project or reviewing code, and it would be super flexible. Any agent could come in, look at those templates or those documents, and know exactly how to behave or how to run a particular workflow.

So yeah, I totally get the concept. You're basically aiming for a kind of universal agentic coding shell that you can drop into any project and have it just work with whatever coding AI you're using. It's like a universal adapter for your coding agents. Let’s dive in and figure out how we’d piece that together!

You said:
“Okay, so let's continue with our conversation, okay? So far, you understand everything I've said, right?”
00:09
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I've got it all so far. We want to build that kind of universal framework that any coding AI can just plug into and understand exactly how to operate with your projects. So yep, I'm right there with you—let's keep the conversation going and dive deeper!

You said:
“Perfect. So my current framework to start is, I use Cloud Code, and I have these commands, and these commands allow me to basically call prompts and do specific things. But before we do that, I want to talk to you about my current AI docs folder directory, which you're probably already familiar with, but this is something that I've been using and really helps me speed up implementation. So it starts with an AI-docs folder at the top in the repo. The AI-docs folder has multiple subdirectories, and they're named as follows. 0-brainstorming, 1-prompts, 2-specs, 3-resources, 4-issues. Now the ones that I'm using quite a bit are 0-brainstorming and 2-specs, and I have a prompt in 1-prompts that will take the brainstorming session and use a system prompt that will guide it to create a very detailed specification plan. And so the way I do it is, for example, there's a command that says, that's just brain2-specs, and then I give it a number. So the very first thing in this entire workflow is what we're doing now. So imagine me just creating a brainstorming session. We are brainstorming together. After this is done, that brainstorming session gets saved to a session-1.md. That one number is important because that is what dictates which session to convert from a brainstorming session to a very defined specification document. The specification document then drives the coding. So for example, brain2-specs space 1, that command will basically trigger the AI to review the session-1.md and create a specs-1.md in the 2-specs folder or subdirectory under AIDocs. So what happens here is, we have all our brainstorming sessions in the brainstorming folder. Then 1-prompts contains these commands that would enable us to perform an action, calling an agent that will perform a specific action. And then 2-specs will have all the specification documents that it created. So the prompt, there's going to be a brain2-specs prompt in 1-prompts that's going to drive that conversion. So does that make sense to you?”
03:33
ChatGPT said:
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, and it's actually a pretty clever setup. So you're using your AI-docs directory almost like a structured pipeline: you have a brainstorming folder where we start the raw ideas, and then you have a command that transforms that brainstorming markdown file into a very detailed spec in another folder. And that spec is what then drives the coding or the implementation phase.

So I can see how it all fits together. You’ve got this nice, repeatable workflow where every brainstorming session gets its own unique markdown file, and then that unique number ties it to the corresponding spec. And the commands in your prompts folder kind of automate that conversion. So yeah, it all clicks into place for me, and it sounds like a really solid system. Let’s keep going!

You said:
“Perfect, perfect. So then, you know, what I'm thinking that is that we're probably, there's probably another folder that is missing in here. And this folder, I think the way we want to implement this is we want a workflows folder. And the workflows folder, what that does is it's going to have another prompt and it's, think of it as a meta prompt, meaning in a workflow folder, we are going to potentially have multiple, potentially have multiple steps. Like for example, the first, if I'm initiating a project, right, I'd want to first convert the brainstorming session to a specification document. Then I would want another agent to look at the specification document and review it and make sure it's not over-engineered. So then I have an over-engineering, like a simplification agent that looks at the session and the specification document and looks for anything that was added as additional features is basically over-engineered. If you're not, if the specs don't reflect exactly what was provided in a brainstorming session, right, then what's happening and it's adding additional and the specs is adding additional features I did not request. This over, this simplification agent or this spec review agent would make sure that the specification plan will get updated and the over-engineering and features would be removed from it, okay. So now we have a workflow, right. We have a workflow where we're calling the first agent, right, to do something and then we have another agent that does another thing, right. So now I'm getting to a point where we have an agentic workflow and the question here is this, like do we use a tool like LandGraph to be able to kind of architect this out or maybe that's the way to do it. So if we use a tool like LandGraph, we can just call a Python function that will basically start this workflow and customize it the way we want it.”
02:26
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, I think you're onto a really interesting path here. So adding a workflows folder is basically going to give you that layer of orchestration. You're creating a kind of meta-prompt system where you have a sequence of agents doing their thing one after another. The first one converts your brainstorm into a spec, and then a second agent reviews that spec to make sure it hasn't been over-engineered and that it sticks strictly to what was in the brainstorming session—keeping it nice and minimal, just like you want.

Now, as for how to actually orchestrate this, using something like LangGraph could be a great idea. LangGraph or a similar tool would let you define these workflows as a series of steps, and you could just run a Python function to set everything in motion. That way, the workflow folder essentially defines the sequence: first run the brainstorming-to-spec agent, then run the simplification agent, and so on. And you can customize that workflow as needed for different projects.

So in a nutshell, yes, this all makes perfect sense, and using a tool like LangGraph could be a really clean way to architect these agentic workflows so that everything just flows smoothly and stays flexible. Let’s keep building on that!

You said:
“Okay, so here's the thing that I want to do first. It's that we may not actually need Zenduref in order to perform this work, because we may just be able to use a workflow.md that has the prompt to prompt the agent to post a form to the BrainFit stack, to call the BrainFit stack's prompt, and then call the review agent to simplify the specification. So I want to start with that first to see if maybe only that is required in order for us to use agents that are actually basically doing what you see right off the bat. We may not need a language implementation if the agents are smart enough to perform this DEVELOP-A-LANGUAGE framework.”
01:00
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. I think starting simple is a great approach. If your agents are already smart enough and the workflow can be driven just by reading a markdown file that lays out the sequence of steps, then yeah, you might not need something like LangGraph right away.

In other words, you can just rely on a really straightforward meta-prompting approach: have a workflow markdown file that lists the sequence of actions, and then let each agent read those instructions and just call the next step. That way you keep it lightweight and you only add

You said:
“Thank you. Sorry, I didn't hear you. We're out of the grilled red onion. Do you want something else instead? Oh, what do you have? We can do regular onion. How about avocado? Oh, is it still on there? Okay. More on top. You can slice it. Thank you. What else can we do? How about another egg? Another egg? Yeah. Okay, thanks. No problem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.”

ChatGPT said:
No worries at all! It sounds like you were juggling a couple of things at once. And hey, adding another egg to the mix is always a good idea. So yeah, just let me know whenever you're ready to continue. We're all good on this end!

You said:
“Okay, so can you summarize our conversation so far?”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here’s a quick summary of what we’ve talked through:

We started off with your idea of building a universal agentic coding framework. You described how you have this AI-docs directory that includes subfolders like brainstorming, prompts, and specs. Basically, you have a command that takes a brainstorming session and converts it into a detailed spec document. Then you mentioned adding a workflows folder,

You said:
“For more information, please visit www.chatgpt.com.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
No problem, I'll keep it going from there! So after we talked about your existing setup with

You said:
“Thank you.”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
Sure! So just to wrap it up, we covered that you want to add a workflows folder to define sequences of agents. Each workflow will basically be a markdown file that outlines which agent to run first, like converting a brainstorm to a spec, and then which agent to run next, like simplifying that spec. And we agreed that you can start simple, just using these markdown-defined workflows, without needing a more complex orchestration tool right away. And if you ever need that later, you can add it on. So that’s the gist of it!

You said:
“How would you outline a subdirectory now, given that we have a new subdirectory called Workflows? It has to be naturally referenced, right? And remember, the resource subdirectory is more of a reference or an ad documentation for tools, markdown, and documentation. I'm not that serious that the AI can reference, but I wanted to basically make it so the layout of the subdirectory is good enough.”
00:36
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Let's outline how the subdirectories would look now that we're adding a workflows folder and keep everything intuitive.

So you'd have something like this in your AI-docs directory:

0-brainstorming: This is where all your brainstorming markdown files live. Each brainstorming session is saved here, and these files are basically your raw ideas.

1-prompts: This folder contains your prompt files—basically the commands or templates that guide the AI on what to do. For example, the "brain2specs" prompt lives here, and it tells the AI how to convert a brainstorm into a spec.

2-specs: This is where the generated specification documents go after the brainstorming session is turned into a detailed plan. Each spec corresponds to a brainstorming session.

3-resources: Like you said, this is more like a reference library—any documentation, tools, or markdown files that the AI can reference when it needs additional context.

4-issues: (If you have this folder) it might be for any known issues or troubleshooting notes.

5-workflows (the new one): This is the new subdirectory where you define these orchestrated sequences of actions. Each workflow markdown file will lay out which agents to run in what order, so it acts as a meta-instruction set for how to chain the agents together.

By ordering them this way, everything flows naturally from brainstorming to prompts to specs and now to workflows, making it really intuitive to navigate. Let me know if that all makes sense!

You said:
“Can you still hear me?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
I sure can! I’m here and I can hear you loud and clear. If there's anything else you need to tweak or if you have any more questions, just let me know!

You said:
“Okay, so I like you adding the workflow folder at the very end. So I think another thing that we need to do, and I'm trying to understand how we could do this, right? So sometimes agents have the ability to leverage tools, right? And tools would be basically any type of CLI, MCP server, things like that. So I think in our AI process, in our AI docs, right, I'm wondering if we should have a folder or subdirectory called tools, and then inside of tools we would have specific CLIs, subdirectories. There would be just built CLI tools that the agent, that these workflows can reference in order to extract or call, you know, or gather more information. Now here's one thing, like I'm trying to see whether this fits this AI docs framework, because as soon as you start putting code in here, it's not just documentation anymore, right? It's not just prompts, it's something else. So what are your thoughts on this?”
01:31
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that's a really good point to consider. Once you start adding actual code or executable tools into the AI-docs structure, it does shift from being purely documentation and prompts into something more hybrid.

If you do want to include a tools subdirectory, that could definitely be done. You'd essentially be saying: okay, this AI-docs directory isn't just about instructions and documentation anymore—it's also the place where you store any command-line tools or scripts that the agents might need to call.

So you could have a structure like this:

0-brainstorming

1-prompts

2-specs

3-resources (still your reference materials)

4-issues (if you have it)

5-workflows (your meta-instructions)

6-tools (where you actually put the CLI tools or scripts that agents can run)

This way, you're being explicit that the AI-docs directory is now a kind of all-in-one directory for both the documentation and the actual executable helpers. And as long as that works for you and it's clear for anyone else who's using it, then it can absolutely fit into your framework. It just expands the purpose of AI-docs a bit. Let me know what you think!

You said:
“Keep going.”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! So continuing along that line, if you do integrate a tools subdirectory as part of your AI-docs structure, you're essentially making it a more holistic hub. It won't just be where you store

You said:
“Thank you, and have a great day.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
You're very welcome! I'm glad that helps you think it all through. If you need to chat more about it or if you have any other tweaks or ideas as you go along, just let me know. I'm here to help!

You said:
Ok so how would our ai-docs look like now ? 
ChatGPT said:
Here’s how your updated ai-docs structure could look now that you’ve added a 5-workflows folder and optionally considered adding executable tools or utilities:

Would you like me to generate a starter README.md file to explain this structure inside the folder?

You said:
“Okay, so let's recap what we have so far.”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let’s recap what we’ve put together so far.

Overall AI-Docs Structure:
You’ve now got a directory called ai-docs that is organized into multiple subdirectories. Each subdirectory has a clear purpose, and we’ve aligned the naming conventions to use session1.md, session2.md for brainstorming files and specs1.md, specs2.md for the specification files.

Key Points Recapped:

0-brainstorming:
This folder holds all your initial brainstorming sessions, each saved as session1.md, session2.md, and so forth.

1-prompts:
This folder contains the prompt files that guide your AI agents. For example, the brain2spec.md prompt tells the AI how to convert a brainstorming session into a specification.

2-specs:
This folder stores the specs that result from the brainstorming sessions, named specs1.md, specs2.md, and so on.

3-resources:
This is where you keep reference materials, examples, or any documentation the AI might need to look up.

4-issues:
(Optional) A place to log known issues or questions that need to be addressed.

5-workflows:
This new folder contains markdown files defining the sequences of agent actions. Each workflow file lays out the steps in order, like converting a brainstorm to a spec and then simplifying it.

6-tools:
(Optional) If you decide to include actual CLI tools or scripts, they can go here, making the ai-docs directory a one-stop shop for both documentation and tools.

In Summary:
We’ve structured everything so that each type of file has its own place, the naming is consistent and easy to follow, and you have a clear workflow that starts from brainstorming and ends in a well-defined spec. And if you want, it can also include the tools to run everything.

If that all sounds good, you’re set! And of course, if you need anything else, just let me know.

You said:
“Okay, so I have another folder that I think we should probably add to. This folder is specific for transcripts that occur between, you know, two humans. For example, I just had a conversation with a coworker of mine about creating this new project with these new requirements. So it's more of a transcript. The difference between the session folder, which is the first one, and this new folder, transcripts, is that the session folder is more about brainstorming, right? Like we're going to turn a session into a brainstorming document. Maybe, actually, maybe this is the way to do this. Maybe this is the way to do this. So a session can either be a brainstorming session or just a regular transcript between two people, right? And then the prompt that I apply to it would determine whether it becomes a specification document from a brainstorming session or just like a meeting notes from a transcript. So then what I would need, I think this entire framework would still work, but I do need an additional, meaning I can apply a meeting notes summary or a meeting notes type of prompt, right? That would take a transcript and convert it into, I don't know if meeting notes is the right way to do it. Is there a right way to say it? If you have a better idea for that. But basically what I want to do is I want to create this new document, which is not quite a specification, right, document. It's more of a, I don't know what, maybe a PRD, product requirement document.”
02:08
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. So what you're envisioning is that a single "session" could be either a brainstorming session or just a straightforward transcript of a meeting or discussion. Then, depending on the prompt you apply, that session can turn into different kinds of output documents.

So we might not need a separate "transcripts" folder at all. Instead, we just keep everything under that 0-brainstorming (or maybe we rename it to something like 0-sessions) folder. Then you apply different prompts to convert a session into either a specification document (if it was a brainstorm) or into something like meeting notes or even a product requirements document (PRD) if it was more of a project discussion.

In that case, you could have a prompt like "session-to-meeting-notes.md" or "session-to-prd.md" that tells the AI how to convert a general conversation into those formats.

So your structure would remain largely the same, but the 0-brainstorming folder would become 0-sessions, and it would hold both brainstorming sessions and meeting transcripts. The type of output just depends on which prompt you run on the session.

That way, you keep it flexible and unified. Let me know if that sounds good or if you’d like any other tweaks!

You said:
“Yeah, actually, that's perfect. So what you're basically suggesting is having two additional markdown files in the prompts directory, which would do specific things such as converting a session to a PRD or a session to a meeting notes, right? Is that correct?”
00:23
ChatGPT said:
Yes, exactly! You've got it. So you’d have a couple of extra markdown prompts in that 1-prompts directory—one for turning a session into a PRD and another for turning a session into meeting notes.

That way, you can just take any session file from your 0-sessions folder and decide what you want it to become by applying the appropriate prompt. It keeps things flexible and allows you to generate different types of documents from the same source material.

So yep, that’s exactly the idea!

You said:
“Okay, but where do these documents go, though? Because now, we have to keep in mind that we have three different types of outputs, right? One is a meeting notes output. One is a specification document output, which contains atomic and subatomic tasks. And one is a product requirement document. So, would you suggest having additional folders in our AI docs directory that would have those two additional folders?”
00:35
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that’s a great point. Since you’re now dealing with multiple distinct types of output, it makes sense to give each one its own dedicated folder. That way, everything stays organized and you know exactly where to find each type of document.

So let’s refine the structure to include two additional subdirectories:

A folder for meeting notes output.

A folder for product requirement documents (PRDs).

Here’s how the updated ai-docs structure would look with these new folders:

In Summary:

0-sessions/ holds all the raw input sessions.

1-prompts/ contains the prompts to turn sessions into specs, PRDs, or meeting notes.

2-specs/ stores specification documents.

7-meeting-notes/ is for your meeting notes outputs.

8-prds/ is for product requirement documents.

This way, each type of output has a clear home. Let me know if that setup works for you!

“Okay, so I think we need to kind of reorganize things a little bit, because if you think about it, right, from a development plan, okay, when we're creating software, we have to kind of, I think we have to change the order a little bit, because, for example, what is the difference between a product requirement document and a specification document? Maybe specification is not the right term. The way I use specification document is basically that is the document that drives the AI coding implementation, whereas I think the product requirement document is a little bit more high level, so that should really come before the specification document. And the very first folder should still be brainstorming, because that's where we kind of brainstorm. So that's what I need. I need to help kind of organizing the sequence of these folders, because the sequence matters in how we structure and how we conduct our development, our workflow, or framework from top down.”

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. Let's reorganize the structure so that it flows in a logical order from brainstorming, to defining requirements, and then down to the more detailed specifications that drive the actual coding.

Here’s how we can lay it out:

0-brainstorming/: This remains the first folder. It’s the starting point where you capture all your initial ideas and brainstorming sessions.

1-prds/: Next up is the product requirements documents. These are higher-level documents that come from converting a brainstorming session into a PRD. They outline the big picture requirements before you drill down into details.

2-specs/: After the PRD, you get into the specification documents. These are the more detailed documents that come from further refining the PRD or directly from a brainstorming session if you prefer. They contain the atomic and subatomic tasks that will guide the actual coding process.

3-meeting-notes/: You can then have a folder for meeting notes. These are the more informal or summarizing documents created from sessions that are not necessarily about defining requirements or specifications, but more about summarizing discussions.

4-prompts/: The prompts folder can come after these output folders. It will contain all the templates that drive the conversions, whether you’re going from a brainstorming session to a PRD, spec, or meeting notes.

5-workflows/: Finally, you have the workflows folder, which describes the sequences of how all these pieces come together.

So the revised order would be:

ai-docs/
├── 0-brainstorming/       # Initial idea sessions
├── 1-prds/            # High-level product requirement documents
├── 2-specs/            # Detailed specification documents
├── 3-meeting-notes/     # Summaries of general meetings or transcripts
├── 4-prompts/          # Prompts for converting sessions to outputs
├── 5-workflows/       # Workflow definitions
└── 6-tools/ (optional) # Any scripts or utilities if needed
This way, you’re flowing from brainstorming, to high-level requirements (PRDs), to detailed specs, and then into meeting notes and prompts, with workflows and tools at the end. Let me know if that ordering works better for you!

You said:
“Yeah, I think that order does work better for me now. Where is the resources folder again?”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
I’m glad that order works better for you! Absolutely, we can make sure the resources folder is still in there as well.

Let’s slot it back in at a logical point. The resources folder is kind of a reference area that can be helpful across all stages, so it makes sense to have it available early on.

Here’s the revised order with the resources folder included:

ai-docs/
├── 0-brainstorming/        # Initial idea sessions
├── 1-prds/             # High-level product requirements
├── 2-specs/             # Detailed specification documents
├── 3-meeting-notes/      # Summaries of general meetings
├── 4-resources/         # Reference documents, examples, guidelines
├── 5-prompts/           # Prompts for converting sessions to outputs
├── 6-workflows/        # Workflow definitions
└── 7-tools/ (optional)  # Any scripts or utilities if needed
Now the resources folder is right after the main types of output documents and before the prompts. That should give you easy access to any reference material you might need as you work through the process.

Let me know if that placement looks good!

You said:
“So, hold on, just summarize again, what is the order again?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Of course! Here’s the final order summarized once more:

0-brainstorming/: This is where you start with all your initial idea sessions and brainstorming files.

1-prds/: Next, you have the product requirements documents that come from refining those brainstorms into high-level requirements.

2-specs/: Then you have the specification documents that go into more detail, defining the atomic and subatomic tasks for implementation.

3-meeting-notes/: After that, you have a folder for meeting notes, which are summaries of general discussions or transcripts.

4-resources/: The resources folder comes next, providing reference documents, guidelines, or examples you might need.

5-prompts/: Then you have the prompts folder, which contains the templates for converting sessions into PRDs, specs, or meeting notes.

6-workflows/: After that, the workflows folder defines the sequences of how everything is put together.

7-tools/ (optional): Finally, you have a tools folder if you need to include any scripts or utilities.

That’s the complete order from top to bottom. Hopefully, that makes it easy to follow the development flow. Let me know if that’s all clear!

You said:
“Okay, I don't think, don't you think resources should be at the very end because it's not as widely used?”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, we can definitely move the resources folder to the end if that makes more sense for your workflow. If it’s not something you’ll be referencing as often, it can definitely sit at the end of the directory without any problem.

So the final order would look like this:

ai-docs/
├── 0-brainstorming/      # Initial idea sessions
├── 1-prds/           # High-level product requirements
├── 2-specs/           # Detailed specification documents
├── 3-meeting-notes/    # Summaries of general meetings
├── 4-prompts/         # Prompts for converting sessions to outputs
├── 5-workflows/      # Workflow definitions
├── 6-tools/ (optional) # Any scripts or utilities if needed
└── 7-resources/     # Reference documents, examples, guidelines (less frequently used)
Now the resources folder is at the very end, so it’s there if you need it but not in the main workflow path. Let me know if that looks perfect now!

You said:
“Okay, yeah, I do like that, I do like that. Now, so we have everything we need at this point in order to create this new AI development workflow. We're going to take this AI development workflow and bring it into as a generic way to start projects. Now, my question is this, how would you recommend creating like a scaffolding template that would basically initialize this workflow every time I initialize a project? I use Python quite a bit, so Python probably would be the way to do this. But, you know, I also program across other languages such as Rust, C Sharp, PyScript. You know, so how do we do this in a way that I think the obvious solution would be just creating a Python script that would allow me to create a template, or sorry, a scaffolding project in my directory, right, with everything ready to go. What would you recommend?”
01:31
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. Using a Python script to generate the scaffolding is a great approach, especially since Python is something you're very comfortable with. Plus, a Python-based tool can be flexible enough to generate a project structure that supports different languages like Rust or C# as well.

Here’s a recommendation on how to do it:

Create a Python scaffolding script: Write a Python script that, when run, prompts you for some basic information about the new project (like the project name, target language if relevant, or any optional components).

Use a templating system or simple file copying: You can use a templating tool like Jinja2 if you want some dynamic content in your files, or just have the script copy a set of template files and folders into the new project directory.

Organize the ai-docs structure automatically: When you run the script, it should create the ai-docs directory and all the subdirectories in the correct order that we just discussed. It can also place any initial markdown files or prompt templates you want to have in there by default.

Make it extensible: Even though the script is written in Python, it can generate scaffolding for projects in other languages. For example, it could create a directory that includes Rust files, C# files, or Pine Script files if you specify that as part of the project initialization.

Optional: Use a tool like Cookiecutter: If you want to leverage an existing tool, you could use something like Cookiecutter, which is a popular Python project templating tool. You define a template once, and then you can generate new projects from that template with just a command.

In summary, I’d recommend a simple Python script (or Cookiecutter if you want something pre-built) that sets up the entire ai-docs structure for you and any other boilerplate files you need. That way, every time you start a new project, you have a consistent starting point.

You said:
“Yeah, so I'm on the fence of using a tool like Cookie Cutter because, you know, it's just not as, I think if it was a lot more involved where there was a lot more files that we would have to implement, then Cookie Cutter would be the way to go, but I want to just keep it being simple. A stretch goal for me would be to actually develop this particular templating schema in Rust, and if I do that in Rust, the cool thing is now I can just take the executable, give it to any other person on the team, and they could just run it on their end, and it would automatically create the folder with all the different structures.”
00:49
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. Keeping it lean and simple is a great idea, and if you’re comfortable with Python for now, that’s a good way to start. Then, as a stretch goal, rewriting it in Rust could give you that added flexibility of having a single executable you can share with teammates. They can just run it without needing to set up a Python environment.

In that case, you can start by building a simple Python script that does exactly what you need. Then, when you’re ready, you can port that logic over to Rust. The Rust version can be compiled into a standalone binary, which is super convenient for sharing with others.

So in short: yes, starting with a Python script is a great first step, and then you can translate it into Rust for that extra portability and to make it even easier for your team to use. Sounds like a solid plan!

You said:
“Actually, you know what? Now that I'm thinking about it, I want to actually create this in Rust, right off the bat. It would just be a really good way to... You know, I'm kind of still a beginner in Rust, but it would just be a really good way for me to start integrating, you know, building more things in Rust. And then, you know, we could... By building it in Rust, you know, I could just literally have this specific script be used. You know, I just can provide the executable, and they can run it on their end, and it's done.”
00:32
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a fantastic idea! Diving right into Rust for this project is a great way to get more comfortable with the language and you’ll end up with a nice, portable executable that anyone can run easily.

To get started, you can set up a new Rust project and use something like Rust’s standard library for file and directory operations.

You said:
“Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I got another idea. What if, and tell me if this is possible, is there a way to create a template in GitHub”
00:14
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that's a really good idea as well. GitHub actually has a feature specifically for this: you can create a repository and mark it as a template repository. That way, whenever you or anyone else wants to start a new project with the same structure, you can just click "Use this template" on GitHub and it will create a new repository with all the same files and folders.

So the process would be something like this:

Create a new GitHub repository and set it up exactly the way you want your ai-docs structure to look, with all the directories and any placeholder files you want.

In the repository settings, you can mark it as a template repository.

Once it's a template, you or anyone else can go to that repository on GitHub and click a button to create a new repo based on that template.

This approach is really straightforward and doesn't require any extra tooling on the user's end beyond GitHub itself. And it’s a nice, clean way to ensure consistency across projects.

So if that sounds good to you, it’s definitely possible and might be a nice alternative or complement to your Rust executable idea!

You said:
“So, currently what I'm doing is this entire scaffolding process is being currently worked in a GitHub repo called AI-DEV-ENVIRONMENT, AI-DEV-ENVIRONMENT. Is there a way to convert this GitHub repo into a template?”
00:20
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! You can convert your existing GitHub repo into a template pretty easily. Here’s how you do it:

Go to your repository on GitHub. In this case, open up your ai-dev-environment repo.

Go to the Settings tab. At the top of the repo page, you’ll see a “Settings” option. Click on that.

Enable the template setting. In the repository settings, scroll down until you find the "Template repository" option. Just check the box that says “Template repository” and save your changes.

Once you’ve done that, your ai-dev-environment repo will become a template. Anyone (including you) can then click “Use this template” to create a new repository with the same structure.

So yes, you can definitely turn your existing repo into a template in just a couple of steps!

You said:
“Okay, and I can make the template private still, right? Correct, so it's just available to me?”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
Yes, absolutely! You can definitely keep the template private. When you mark a repository as a template on GitHub, it doesn't change its visibility settings. So if your repository is private, it will remain private even after you turn it into a template.

This means only you (and anyone else you've given access to) will be able to see and use that template. It won't be publicly visible unless you choose to make it public. So

You said:
“All right, I think we're ready to hand this off to an AI planner. We're going to basically just take this entire brainstorming conversation and implement the entire scaffolding inside of a repo. And so we are done with our brainstorming session, and we're ready to hand this off to the AI planner. So the interesting part is the AI planner. So I already have an existing scaffolding inside this repo that uses some of these prompts already. But now the difference is once this implementation is complete, the scaffolding process will actually be different and updated to this new workflow and folder structure.”
00:52
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a fantastic plan! I love how you've thought through the structure and the workflow. Once the AI planner gets this new template, it'll be much easier to spin up new projects with this consistent structure. If you need any more help as you move forward, just let me know!

You said:
“Can you just do a final detailed implementation plan and summary of the entire project?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here's a detailed implementation plan and summary for the new AI development workflow:

Implementation Plan
1. Repository Structure
Main Repository Name: ai-dev-environment

Subdirectories:

brainstorming/: For all brainstorming session notes (session1.md, session2.md, etc.).

prd/: For product requirement documents (prd1.md, prd2.md, etc.).

specs/: For detailed specification documents (specs1.md, specs2.md, etc.).

transcripts/: For meeting or conversation transcripts that are not brainstorming sessions.

workflows/: For workflow definitions and meta-prompts.

resources/: For any reference materials and tools.

2. Prompts and Automation
Brainstorming to PRD: A prompt that takes a brainstorming session and converts it into a product requirement document.

PRD to Specs: A prompt that takes a PRD and generates a detailed specification document.

Meeting Notes: A prompt that takes regular conversation transcripts and summarizes them into concise meeting notes.

3. Scaffolding Tool
Language: Rust

Functionality: A command-line tool that initializes a new project with the defined folder structure and template files.

Distribution: An executable that can be shared with the team to quickly set up the project.

4. Template Repository
Convert the ai-dev-environment repo into a private template so that it can be reused easily for new projects.

5. Resources and Tools
Resources Folder: Contains any additional documentation or tools that might be referenced by the AI agents.

With this plan in place, you’ll have a streamlined, organized workflow that makes it easy to kick off new projects with a consistent structure. If you need any more details or adjustments, just let me know!
