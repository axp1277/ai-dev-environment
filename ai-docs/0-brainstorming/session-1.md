“Hello there, how are you? Ready to brainstorm with me today?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I’m ready when you are! I'm doing great and always up for a brainstorming session. Just let me know what we’re diving into today.

You said:
“So, I am building this multi-timeframe level detector algorithm in Rust. And I want you to help me with basically implementing this entire application from start to end. I already have some of these elements in place, so we will be updating an existing repo, okay? So, so far, do you understand?”
00:33
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, absolutely, I'm with you so far! So we're talking about enhancing your Rust codebase to build out a multi-timeframe level detector. We’ll take the existing repo you have and basically implement the full application step-by-step. Just let me know what specific pieces you want to focus on first, and we’ll dive in!

You said:
“Okay, so the way we're going to bring this conversation out is I'm going to basically tell you how I look at a chart and how I do an analysis every single day. And then every time I identify something that needs to be implemented or coded up, I will let you know, and then we can go ahead and provide a plan on how to code that piece up. Does that make sense?”
00:34
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Basically, you'll walk me through your daily chart analysis process, and as we spot each element that needs to be turned into code, we’ll break it down and figure out how to implement it in Rust. I’m totally on board with that approach. Just go ahead and start describing, and we’ll take it from there!

You said:
“Okay, so the other thing that I wanted to bring a little bit more context here, and before we dive into the process, this is what I'm trying to move forward with, okay? Rust is very fast. Python is also very good, and I'm actually a Python expert, but I'm not. I'm just beginning to learn Rust. What I want to do is I want to offload the heavy lifting to Rust, like the intensive processing and looping through all the candlesticks to extract all the levels. That would go all to Rust, and then Python would basically just have, you know, we'll just have Python as a front end, sorry, as a way to read all the levels from a JSON file, and then render a candlestick chart and overlay all those levels onto the candlestick chart using Plotly. So far, does everything make sense? Do you think this is a viable approach? Do you think my reasoning is thoughtful? Be critical.”
01:13
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, I think your reasoning is definitely solid and it's actually a pretty common approach. Using Rust for the heavy lifting, like crunching through all the candlestick data and extracting those levels, is a great way to leverage Rust’s speed. And then having Python handle the visualization side, especially since you're already super comfortable with Python and tools like Plotly, makes a lot of sense.

So yes, it's definitely a viable approach and it’s a nice way to get the best of both worlds. And I think this division of labor between the two languages will keep things clean and maintainable. So I'm all in! Let’s do it.

You said:
“I mean, so let me ask you this. Does Rust have any packages? Like, how good is Rust in terms of front-end visualization?”
00:11
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, so when it comes to Rust and front-end visualization, it's a bit of a different landscape compared to Python. Rust is super strong in performance and systems programming, but it doesn’t have as many mature visualization libraries as Python does.

There are some crates out there, like plotters, which can do some charting, and you can create SVGs or even generate HTML-based outputs. But it's definitely not as plug-and-play or as rich as something like Plotly in Python.

So typically, a lot of folks do exactly what you’re suggesting: they use Rust for the backend heavy lifting and then use Python, or JavaScript even, for the front-end visualization. That’s a really common pattern, and it’s a great way to take advantage of each language’s strengths. So I’d say you’re on the right track!

You said:
“Yeah, so then the other thing that I wanted to basically keep in mind is when I create Rust applications, right, there's also that element of proprietary, meaning I can compile all that stuff and not expose any of the source code, which is a big advantage.”
00:18
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that’s a great point. Compiling Rust down to a binary does give you that nice advantage of keeping your source code private. So if you’re distributing this tool or you just want to keep your proprietary logic under wraps, Rust is definitely helpful there.

And it sounds like you’ve got a really good architectural vision: Rust on the back end doing the heavy lifting and keeping things fast and secure, and then Python on the front end for all the visualization and flexibility. So it all lines up really well. We can definitely move forward with that plan!

You said:
“Let me ask you another question. Can I call Rust from a NinjaTrader C-Sharp NinjaScript strategy?”
00:10
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, that’s a good question! So basically, it is possible, but it does require a bit of a bridge. What you’d usually do is compile your Rust code into something like a DLL or a shared library. And then from NinjaScript, since that’s C#, you can actually use something like a P/Invoke call to call into that compiled Rust library. So it’s definitely doable. It just adds that extra step of compiling your Rust code into a format that C# can call. But once you do that, you can definitely integrate it, and it’s a neat way to get some Rust performance inside your NinjaTrader strategy.

You said:
“So what would a DLL be again? Like, um, so, I mean, if once it's compiled into a DLL, I can basically call those states the same Rust functions that I would call in Python or native Rust in C-sharp?”
00:14
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, exactly! So once you compile your Rust code into a DLL, which is a dynamic link library, it basically becomes a shared library that you can call from other languages like C#. So in the same way that you would call a Rust function in Python using something like PyO3, on the C# side you’d use a P/Invoke or a similar mechanism to call those Rust functions from the DLL.

So yes, you can absolutely reuse those Rust functions in C#, just like you would in another environment. It's just about having that compiled piece of Rust code that C# can interface with. So it's definitely a workable setup!

You said:
“Alright, perfect. So, now that we kind of have, this makes me even more prone to trying to convert as much of the logic to Rust as possible. So, you know, we just basically code the logic once, and then we can use that same logic across other languages, such as Python, C Sharp, or just native Rust per se.”
00:25
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, exactly! That’s one of the really nice perks of going this route. If you write that core logic in Rust once, then you've got this high-performance piece of code that you can tap into from Python, from C#, or run it natively in Rust. It’s kind of like building a universal engine that you can plug into different front-ends or different workflows. So it definitely makes sense and it's a great way to maximize the effort you're putting into that Rust logic. And I think it'll serve you really well across the board. So yeah, let's go for it!

You said:
“The other thing that I want to ask you is, when we compile something in Rust, right, in a DLL, for example, or an executable, is there a way to control which functions that are public? Meaning, if I were to basically distribute this DLL to a client, but I would want the client to only have access to certain functions based on his subscription tier, is there a way to actually do that? How would you do it?”
00:32
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, absolutely. So in Rust, you definitely have control over which functions are exposed publicly when you compile to a DLL or any kind of shared library. Basically, you’d use Rust’s visibility rules to control what’s public and what’s not. So you might mark certain functions with the pub keyword if you want them accessible, and keep others private if you don’t.

Now, if you want to get a bit more sophisticated and control access based on something like a subscription tier, you’d typically build that logic into the Rust code itself. For example, you could have a function that checks some kind of license key or subscription token before allowing certain methods to run. That way, even if they have the DLL, they can only access the functions that their subscription level unlocks.

So in short, you have control over what’s public or private at the code level, and you can add your own logic to enforce access control based on subscription tiers. It’s definitely doable and a nice way to handle that kind of scenario!

You said:
“Yes, yes, so actually I kind of like that idea of having some sort of a license key that is tied to specific functions, right? So each function, I'm kind of envisioning this, right? Like for example, this is the number one issue, the number one problem that I'm facing right now, okay, is I have to basically keep switching, I'm a freelancer, so I have to keep switching between one language to another to satisfy different clients, and I'm continuously duplicating functions because I'm writing the same function in three different languages, right? Or the same process in three different languages. And it's very inefficient, and it's also a nightmare to be able to maintain and understand what is what. So ideally, if I just had one Rust repo, where I basically just dive in and write all the functions, all the logic, that I would then be able to use across multiple languages, and then I can deliver that as a compiled DLL, right? And make it an importable, I could maybe, like for Python, for example, I could make it an importable module, right? In Rust, but then still have the ability to assign a license key to it, and then that license key would only uncover certain functions.”
01:42
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, I think you're absolutely onto a really solid approach here. Essentially, what you're describing is building a kind of central Rust codebase as your universal logic hub. Then you can compile that into a DLL or a shared library and use it in Python, C#, or any other language that can load that library.

And layering on a licensing system on top of that is definitely doable. You can have a mechanism where the Rust code checks a license key before exposing certain functions. For Python, you can absolutely create a Python extension module using something like PyO3, and that module would basically reference the Rust-compiled library. That way, you're only writing and maintaining your core logic once in Rust, and you can control what’s exposed based on the license key. It’s a really efficient way to handle it and will save you a ton of time and headaches from duplicating the same logic across multiple languages. So yeah, I think that’s a great plan!

You said:
“So let me ask you a question, then. How do you dynamically expose functions without having to actually change the function type from public to private? Because that would basically have to trigger a recompile. I don't want to have to trigger a recompile every time I'm giving this to another person. Does that make sense? How does that work at Rust? What is the best way to do that?”
00:33
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, that makes total sense, and you definitely don’t want to have to recompile just to change which functions are exposed. The best way to handle that is to keep all the functions you might want to expose publicly available at the code level, and then control access at runtime using logic inside the functions themselves.

For example, you could have all your functions defined as public in the Rust code, but have each function check a license key or some permission configuration before actually running its logic. If the license or tier doesn’t match, the function can just return an error or a “not authorized” message.

In other words, all the functions remain public, but the internal logic of each function decides whether it should proceed based on the provided license. That way you compile once and just control the access dynamically. It’s a really flexible way to handle it and you won’t have to recompile for each client.

You said:
“So let me ask you a way, and how would you do this elegantly? Let's make a very simple toy application, okay? For example, let's have a... And by the way, we wouldn't have all these indicators, for example, or processes that would be spread across different files, right? Like in Rust, you know, we may have a folder called Indicators. And then in the Indicators folder, we may have, you know, a different type of indicator, such as a bullish imbalance... Sorry, a fair value gap indicator, for example, that provides a Boolean on the existence of a bullish or bearish imbalance. That could be an indicator, right? Now, we could have an order block function, right, in an order block file, and then within that, we would have bullish and bearish order block public functions. Like, I am a big fan of keeping scripts very short number lines, make all the code very modular, so we can, you know, add indicators if we need it, and so on, right? So, suppose that I wanted to distribute this entire application to a client, the client gets a license key, but I only want the client to have access to imbalances, okay? So, that's the use case here. How would you elegantly make it so, before that function gets run, it checks whether or not that function is, you know, it can be accessed by that specific client?”
01:59
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, absolutely, let's break that down in an elegant way. So the idea is you have this modular Rust codebase with a bunch of different indicators in separate files—like one file for fair value gaps, one for order blocks, and so on—and you want to control which of those indicators a client can actually access based on their license.

So one way to do this elegantly is to have a kind of license-checking function or a middleware layer inside your Rust code. All your indicator functions are public, but at the top of each function you just call a shared utility that checks the license key. If the key doesn't have permission for that function, it returns early with an error or a "not authorized" message. Otherwise, it just goes ahead and runs the function.

So in practice, you might have something like a check_license function that takes the function name and the license key as arguments. Each public function calls check_license at the start. That way, you keep everything modular and only have one central place where the license logic lives. You don't have to recompile anything; you just change the license key or the permissions file, and the code will dynamically allow or deny access. So that's a nice, clean way to do it.

You said:
“Okay, so let me ask you another question. You said at the... I'm a beginner to Rust, okay? I don't know much about Rust. In Python, we have decorators. So a decorator would be something that we would basically run. We would specify that decorator at the top of the function and then it would run that decorator first before calling the function. What is the equivalent Rust common application? In this case, did you just call it a shared library?”
00:33
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, absolutely, and that's a great analogy. So in Rust, you don't have decorators in the same way you do in Python, but you can achieve a similar result using something like a wrapper function or a shared utility function. Basically, you create a little piece of code that runs before your main function logic, and you call that at the start of each function. So it’s kind of like a manual decorator pattern.

In this case, you’d have a common function—let’s say a check_license function—that you call at the start of each indicator function. It’s not a built-in language feature like a Python decorator, but it’s a common Rust pattern to use a shared function for this kind of check.

So you’d just have a little piece of logic that each function calls at the top, and that keeps things nice and modular. And yes, you could think of your overall codebase as a shared library or a crate that you compile and distribute. So it’s a similar concept, just done a little differently in Rust.

You said:
“Okay, so you said it's a it's called a shared utility. Can you just provide us example code, just create two simple function studs, and show me how that would look like in one file. Okay, and also include also the check license function.”
00:17
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, let’s sketch out a simple example to show how that would look. So imagine we have a Rust file with two indicator functions, and we have a check_license function that we call at the top of each one.

So we might have something like this in Rust:

// A mock check_license function that takes a function name and a license key and returns a Result.
fn check_license(func_name: &str, license_key: &str) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    // Here you'd have logic to verify the license.
    // For this toy example, we’ll just check if the license key is "valid_key".
    if license_key == "valid_key" {
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err("Access denied: invalid license.")
    }
}

// An example indicator function that checks for a bullish imbalance.
pub fn bullish_imbalance_indicator(license_key: &str) -> Result<bool, &'static str> {
    check_license("bullish_imbalance_indicator", license_key)?;

    // Indicator logic would go here. For this example, we just return true.
    Ok(true)
}

// Another example indicator function for order blocks.
pub fn order_block_indicator(license_key: &str) -> Result<bool, &'static str> {
    check_license("order_block_indicator", license_key)?;

    // More indicator logic here. For this example, we just return true.
    Ok(true)
}


So what we have here is a check_license function that each indicator function calls at the start. If the license is valid, it proceeds; if not, it returns an error. Each function stays modular and clean, and you have a single place to handle the licensing logic. So that’s how it would look in a simple Rust example.

You said:
“So, I thought in Rust you had the ability to add, like, sometimes when I see Rust functions, they have like a debug at the debug statement at the very top of the function. Like what are those? They kind of look like decorators, but it seems like they're not decorators.”
00:18
ChatGPT said:

Ah, yeah, I get what you’re referring to. So in Rust, you sometimes see attributes that look a bit like decorators in Python. They’re the things you put above a function with a #[...] syntax. For example, #[debug] or #[derive(...)] or things like that.

These are called attributes in Rust. They’re not exactly the same as Python decorators, but they do let you add metadata or enable certain behaviors at compile time. For example, the #[derive(Debug)] attribute automatically implements the Debug trait for a struct, so you can print it easily. But attributes are more about compile-time instructions rather than runtime logic like Python decorators.

So while you can use attributes to add some behaviors, they don’t quite work the same way as Python decorators that wrap functions. For your use case, a simple runtime check inside the function is usually the cleanest approach. It’s just a different pattern, but it gets the job done!

You said:
“Okay, so what you just provided as an example is the recommended approach to doing this. Can you just research and see if there's any other more elegant way to do this, or is this really the recommended way of doing it?”
00:16
ChatGPT said:

So after looking into it, the approach I mentioned is indeed one common and recommended way to do it in Rust, especially for a straightforward runtime check scenario. But there are other patterns that can feel a bit more like a "decorator" if you want something a bit more structured.

One alternative is to use a trait-based pattern. You define a trait that represents your indicator behavior and then create a wrapper struct that implements that trait. This wrapper struct can run your license check before calling the actual indicator logic. It's a bit more elaborate but gives you a more Rust-idiomatic way to "decorate" functions.

In short, what I suggested initially is simple and totally fine, especially if you're just starting out with Rust. But if you want a slightly more "decorator-like" pattern, using traits and wrapper structs is another elegant way to do it. It just depends on how fancy you want to get!

You said:
“Okay, is using a wrapper struct, is this, I guess what I'm trying to get to is, I want to make sure that it is easy to change if I need to change, and it is easy to add additional indicators if I need to add additional indicators. So given the two approaches, one is a simple approach, one is a more advanced approach with traits, how easy is it to add additional indicators? What are the advantages of using the more fancy way of doing it, let's put it this way?”
00:42
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, and that’s a great question. So let’s break it down.

With the simple approach—just calling a check_license function inside each indicator function—it's super easy to add new indicators. You just write a new function, call check_license at the top, and you’re done. It’s very straightforward and doesn’t require any extra structure. So if your main goal is simplicity and quick changes, that’s a solid way to go.

Now, the more advanced approach with traits and a wrapper struct is a bit more structured and can offer some long-term advantages. For example, if you have a trait that all indicators implement, you can add common behavior in one place. The wrapper struct can enforce rules or checks before running any indicator, and if you need to change the logic (like how you validate licenses), you do it in one central place.

In other words, the trait and wrapper pattern gives you a bit more scalability and organization. It might be a bit more initial setup, but if you’re planning to add a lot of indicators or you want a clean, maintainable architecture, it can be worth it. It makes it easy to add new indicators that all follow the same pattern and to change the underlying rules without touching every single function.

So if you want simplicity and quick changes, the simple function approach is great. If you want a more scalable, structured approach, the trait and wrapper method gives you that extra flexibility and maintainability. It really depends on how complex you expect the project to get!

You said:
“You didn't provide a snippet code example. Can you do that real quick?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:

Of course! Let’s do a quick snippet to illustrate the trait and wrapper approach.

Here's an example of how you might structure it:

// Define a trait for indicators
pub trait Indicator {
    fn check(&self, license_key: &str) -> Result<bool, &'static str>;
}

// This is our wrapper struct that will do the license check before calling the actual indicator logic.
pub struct LicenseCheckedIndicator<T: Indicator> {
    inner: T,
}

impl<T: Indicator> LicenseCheckedIndicator<T> {
    pub fn new(inner: T) -> Self {
        LicenseCheckedIndicator { inner }
    }

    pub fn check(&self, license_key: &str) -> Result<bool, &'static str> {
        // Here we call the actual indicator's check method but only after verifying the license.
        if license_key == "valid_key" {
            self.inner.check(license_key)
        } else {
            Err("Access denied: invalid license.")
        }
    }
}

// An example indicator that implements the Indicator trait.
pub struct BullishImbalance;

impl Indicator for BullishImbalance {
    fn check(&self, _license_key: &str) -> Result<bool, &'static str> {
        // Here you'd put the actual indicator logic. For now we just return Ok(true).
        Ok(true)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let indicator = BullishImbalance;
    let checked_indicator = LicenseCheckedIndicator::new(indicator);

    // Example of checking the indicator with a valid license.
    match checked_indicator.check("valid_key") {
        Ok(result) => println!("Indicator check passed: {}", result),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}


In this example, we have an Indicator trait that defines a check method. We have a BullishImbalance struct that implements that trait. The LicenseCheckedIndicator is a wrapper that takes any Indicator and adds the license check before calling the indicator’s logic.

This makes it easy to add new indicators: you just create another struct that implements Indicator. The wrapper handles the license logic in one place, and you get a nice scalable structure. So that’s a quick example of how you’d do it!

You said:
“Okay, now provide the same exact example, but use the very simple approach that we had talked about earlier. I just want to compare the two.”
00:07
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Let’s show the simpler approach for comparison.

In this case, we’ll just have a function that checks the license directly inside each indicator function. So no traits or wrappers—just a straightforward function call.

// A simple function to check the license key.
fn check_license(license_key: &str) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    if license_key == "valid_key" {
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err("Access denied: invalid license.")
    }
}

// A simple indicator function that just checks the license at the start.
fn bullish_imbalance(license_key: &str) -> Result<bool, &'static str> {
    check_license(license_key)?;
    // Actual indicator logic goes here. For now, we just return true.
    Ok(true)
}

fn main() {
    // Example of calling the simple function with a license key.
    match bullish_imbalance("valid_key") {
        Ok(result) => println!("Bullish imbalance check passed: {}", result),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}


In this simpler version, each indicator function just calls check_license at the top. If the license is valid, it runs the rest of the logic. If not, it returns an error. This approach is very easy to maintain if you have just a handful of indicators and want to keep things simple. So that’s the comparison!

You said:
“Looking at the two pieces of code, I don't see any advantage in doing the wrapper more advanced one. It seems like the simpler approach is less code and easy to understand. And honestly, it's pretty easy to implement.”
00:17
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, and that's a totally fair takeaway. The simpler approach definitely has the advantage of being easy to understand, quick to implement, and it’s just straightforward. If it does what you need and you're comfortable with it, there's really no need to overcomplicate things. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one, especially when you're getting started or just want to keep it lean. So if that works well for you, I'd say go for it!

You said:
“Yeah, so the only thing that I would probably want to explore is what if instead of having the license key as an input to each function, is there a way and do you think it is better to make the license key public?”
00:20
ChatGPT said:

That's a great thing to consider. Instead of passing the license key into every function, you could indeed store it somewhere more global or shared. For example, you could have a configuration struct or a settings module that holds the license key once, and then all your functions can reference that shared key.

Whether it's better really depends on how you want to structure things. Making the license key public in a controlled way, like in a config object, can make your function signatures cleaner because you’re not passing the key around everywhere. It can also make it easier to update the key in one place if it changes.

On the other hand, if you prefer each function to be very explicit and self-contained, passing the license key directly into each function can make it very clear what’s going on. It’s really a matter of style and how you like to organize your code. Either way is valid, so it just depends on what feels more maintainable for you.

You said:
“Okay, so here's my idea, and I think this is probably the best way to do this. So, bear with me for a second. So we have our two indicator functions. Ideally, the indicator functions should have two inputs, okay? Each indicator function will have two required inputs, and then additional optional inputs based on whether there are properties that need to be set for that specific indicator or parameters. The two inputs are a vector of open, high, low, closed struct data, and then the current bar index we are at. So those would be the inputs to each indicator, because we're dealing with open, high, low, closed data. So we want to know, we want the entire data stream, right? And also we want where we are in the data stream, all right? So where we want to check the condition, let's put it that way. So that would be the first requirement. The output of the indicator can be a Boolean, okay? If there's an indicator that says, okay, is there a bullish imbalance or a bearish balance? It could also be a structure. So if it's a structure, we may be able to add additional properties, right? So, for example, if we test a bullish imbalance, let's keep it simple. Let's do a Boolean for now. It could be a Boolean or any other type, but the output is basically one value, okay? So that would be the ideal thing. At the beginning of each function, inside the function, we add this check license function. When we import this check license from a different module, and so when we call the check license, it's just literally one single line with no inputs, okay? In the other module, let's call it the license checker. That's where we have the logic to check the license, the logic to upload what licenses are valid. How do we map that specific license key to all the different functions that are accessible, right? Does that make sense?”
02:46
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense and I think it’s a really nice approach. Essentially, you’re centralizing the license check in one module—your license checker—and then each indicator function just calls that single line check_license() at the top without needing to pass the key around. That definitely makes your indicator functions cleaner, because now their main inputs are just the data and the index, and all the licensing logic is handled behind the scenes.

It’s a very clean separation of concerns. Your indicators focus purely on the market logic, and the license checker module focuses on who has access to what. And if you ever need to change how licenses are validated or which functions are available for which licenses, you just update that one module. So I think it’s a really good design idea and definitely a nice way to keep things neat and maintainable.

You said:
“So then inside of the license checker, right, we could have a simple way where we basically list, okay, we could check the license against a specific number of license keys that are internally, each license key is mapped to a specific number of function that it has access to, right? So in theory, though, in fact, actually, this is probably a requirement for this, is every time we check a license, it has to have an optional input, or somehow if we can, it would be great. How do we provide the name of the function from which the license, the check license function was called from? We have to supply that input.”
00:52
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. What you're describing is basically a way to tie each license check back to the specific indicator function that called it. That way, the license checker knows which function is being accessed and can verify if the license allows that function.

In Rust, one simple way to do this is to pass the function name as a string argument to the check_license function. For example, each indicator function could call check_license("bullish_imbalance") or check_license("order_block"), and that way the license checker knows exactly which function is being requested.

Another more automated way, if you want to get fancy, is to use Rust’s module system or even macros to capture the function name automatically. But passing the name as a simple string is often the most straightforward and clear approach.

So yes, you can definitely design your license checker to accept a function name parameter, and that way it knows exactly which function is being validated against which license. It’s a great way to make it flexible and keep that logic in one place.

You said:
“All right, perfect. So, to kind of figure out a way to do this, now we have the license checker module, which is a totally separate file, a .rs file that contains all the code for the license checker. Now inside the license checker, we could have different functions that either check licenses against, you know, licenses that are stored in a database on a cloud, right? That would be the ideal thing, right? So, I provide access to a client. I tell the client, I basically give the client access to multiple functions, right? And then that license checker would check against that database, figure out what needs to be, what can be accessed and what can't be accessed, right? And then basically returns an error. If it can't be accessed, it returns a pass. If it doesn't.”

ChatGPT said:

Exactly, you've got it spot on. By having that license_checker.rs as a separate module, you can centralize all the logic about how licenses are validated. And yeah, you can absolutely have it connect to a database or a cloud service where you store all your license info. That way, you can dynamically update who has access to which functions without changing the code itself—just by updating the data in your licensing backend.

So the flow would be: each indicator calls check_license with its function name, the license_checker.rs module looks up that function name and the user's license key in the database or cloud storage, and then it either returns an "access granted" or an "access denied" result. If it's granted, your indicator runs as normal. If not, it returns an error.

It's a really nice, scalable setup, and it gives you a ton of flexibility for managing licenses on the fly. Sounds like a solid plan!

You said:
“Yeah, that's perfect. Now, to basically build this entire framework locally first, I would want to just kind of have a local alternative approach to start. Maybe just having a config.yaml file or something. Here's the problem, right? A config.yaml file is something if I were to distribute it to another client, the YAML file would be visible, and that's not what we want. We actually want the license mapping to all the different functions inside of the Rust code. So we need to compile it inside so it's not visible, correct?”
00:43
ChatGPT said:

Exactly, you’ve got the right idea there. If you want to keep the license mappings secure and not have them exposed in a human-readable config file, then yeah, you’d compile that information directly into the Rust binary. That way, when you distribute the compiled DLL or executable, the license mapping is baked into the code and not sitting in a separate file that someone could just open and read.

For local testing, you could start with something simple—maybe a hard-coded list or a basic in-memory map in the Rust code that associates license keys with allowed functions. Then when you’re ready to go production or share it with clients, you can swap that out for a more secure solution like pulling from a database or a cloud API that only your compiled code can access.

So yeah, having it compiled in is a good way to keep things hidden and make sure the licensing logic is all inside the binary. That’s a solid plan!

You said:
“All right, so let's talk about how would we create the mapping between the function and the licenses, right? So what I would probably think of doing, because we need, we don't, so first of all, we need to be able to generate it. We need a license generator, okay? So this is actually something that another, this could be a helper function for us, right, through a CLI, where I suppose I want to create a new license, right? So when I create a new license, it will start asking me, you know, maybe there's a list of functions that I specify in the hash map, right, that are strings, for example, bullish and balance, bearish and balance. So they're keys, right? And then each key is associated, each key would be associated to one or more license keys. So then when you're doing a check license, all you're doing is you're basically indexing into that hash map key, which is the indicator name, and then seeing if that license key is part of that key value pair.”
01:16
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that’s a great approach. So essentially, you’re building a little license management tool that lets you generate and manage these mappings. You’d have a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to say, “Okay, I want to create a new license key,” and then it would prompt you to pick which functions that license key should have access to.

Under the hood, you’d store these mappings in a HashMap or a similar structure. Each function name is a key, and the value is a list of license keys that are allowed to call that function. Then when check_license is called, you just look up the function name in that HashMap, see if the provided license key is in the list, and that’s it—access granted or denied.

It’s a neat and tidy way to manage everything in one place. And as you said, this whole license generator can just be another helper tool you build in Rust, so you have full control over how licenses are created and managed. That’ll give you a nice seamless workflow from start to finish.

You said:
“Perfect. So now that we have a better picture on how to basically manage licenses, expose different functions, depending on the license key and everything, can you just create a final snippet and provide which functions do I need, first of all, make it a requirement that these indicators or these functions could be spread across multiple .rs files. But that shouldn't matter because all we're doing is we're importing the license checker right into every single one of these functions and then just calling that license checker wherever I want to protect my IP. Does that make sense?”
00:49
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So let’s lay out a final snippet and a quick plan of which functions you'll need.

Overview of the Functions

License Checker Module (license_checker.rs):

A check_license(function_name: &str, license_key: &str) -> Result<(), &str> function that takes the function name and the license key, looks up the allowed keys for that function, and returns Ok if allowed or an error if not.

An internal HashMap or similar structure that stores the mapping of function names to allowed license keys.

Indicator Modules (e.g., indicators/imbalance.rs, indicators/order_block.rs):

Each function, like bullish_imbalance or order_block, calls check_license("function_name", license_key) at the start.

Each function takes its required parameters (like the OHLC data and index) and then runs the indicator logic only if the license check passes.

License Generator Tool:

A CLI tool (optional for now) to create new license keys and map them to functions.

This can be a separate Rust binary that edits the HashMap or updates a database if you go that route in the future.

Example Snippet

Here’s a simplified code outline:

// license_checker.rs
use std::collections::HashMap;

pub struct LicenseChecker {
    allowed_functions: HashMap<&'static str, Vec<&'static str>>,
}

impl LicenseChecker {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let mut allowed_functions = HashMap::new();
        // For example, "bullish_imbalance" is allowed for "license_key_123"
        allowed_functions.insert("bullish_imbalance", vec!["license_key_123"]);
        // Add more functions and allowed keys as needed

        LicenseChecker { allowed_functions }
    }

    pub fn check_license(&self, function_name: &str, license_key: &str) -> Result<(), &str> {
        if let Some(allowed_keys) = self.allowed_functions.get(function_name) {
            if allowed_keys.contains(&license_key) {
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err("Access denied: Invalid license key for this function.")
            }
        } else {
            Err("Function not found.")
        }
    }
}

// indicators/imbalance.rs
use crate::license_checker::LicenseChecker;

pub fn bullish_imbalance(ohlc_data: &[Ohlc], index: usize, license_key: &str) -> Result<bool, &str> {
    let checker = LicenseChecker::new();
    checker.check_license("bullish_imbalance", license_key)?;
    // Indicator logic goes here if the license is valid
    Ok(true)
}


In this setup:

The LicenseChecker struct holds your function-to-license mappings.

Each indicator function imports and uses the LicenseChecker, checks the license, and then proceeds if valid.

The mappings are compiled into the binary, and you can extend this with a CLI tool to manage licenses.

That should give you a good starting point to protect your IP and control access to each function.

You said:
“I still see, though, that when you're defining the bullish order block and the bearish order block or any of the indicator functions, you're passing in the license key. Is there a way to make the license key? Do we need to pass in a license key?”
00:21
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, you can streamline that a bit more so that you don't have to pass the license key into every single function. One common way to do this is to store the license key in some shared state or context, so you only set it once.

For example, you could have a global state or a configuration struct that holds the license key. Then each function just reads the license key from there. That way, you don't have to pass it as an argument every time.

So, for instance, you could have a configuration module that loads the license key once at the start of the application and then every function just calls the license checker using that stored key. It's a little bit of extra setup, but it makes each function cleaner.

In other words, once the license key is set in one central place, all your indicator functions just do a license check without needing it passed in every time. It keeps things nice and tidy.

You said:
“Can you rewrite the snippet?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:

Of course! Let’s rewrite the snippet to incorporate a central configuration where you only set the license key once. That way, each indicator function can just use that shared license key without passing it in as a parameter.

Updated Example Snippet

First, we’ll create a configuration module to hold the license key:

// config.rs
pub struct Config {
    license_key: String,
}

impl Config {
    pub fn new(license_key: &str) -> Self {
        Config {
            license_key: license_key.to_string(),
        }
    }

    pub fn license_key(&self) -> &str {
        &self.license_key
    }
}

// Make a global config instance accessible
lazy_static::lazy_static! {
    pub static ref CONFIG: Config = Config::new("your_license_key_here");
}


Next, we update the license checker to use the global config:

// license_checker.rs
use std::collections::HashMap;

pub struct LicenseChecker {
    allowed_functions: HashMap<&'static str, Vec<&'static str>>,
}

impl LicenseChecker {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let mut allowed_functions = HashMap::new();
        allowed_functions.insert("bullish_imbalance", vec!["your_license_key_here"]);
        // Add other function-to-license mappings here

        LicenseChecker { allowed_functions }
    }

    pub fn check_license(&self, function_name: &str, license_key: &str) -> Result<(), &str> {
        if let Some(allowed_keys) = self.allowed_functions.get(function_name) {
            if allowed_keys.contains(&license_key) {
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err("Access denied: Invalid license key.")
            }
        } else {
            Err("Function not found.")
        }
    }
}


Finally, we update the indicator function so it no longer needs a license key parameter. It will get the license key from the global config:

// indicators/imbalance.rs
use crate::license_checker::{LicenseChecker, CONFIG};

pub fn bullish_imbalance(ohlc_data: &[Ohlc], index: usize) -> Result<bool, &str> {
    let checker = LicenseChecker::new();
    let license_key = CONFIG.license_key();
    checker.check_license("bullish_imbalance", license_key)?;

    // Indicator logic here
    Ok(true)
}


Now the bullish_imbalance function doesn’t take a license key parameter. It just looks up the key from the shared CONFIG. This way, you only set the license key once and all your functions remain clean and consistent.

You said:
“So let's work on the license key checker portion first. So, and actually now, this would not be a license key checker, it would be a license key creator, right? And this would not be distributed with the code that I would provide the client. This is basically just a utility that I would use to create license keys, okay? So what I need from you is I need, basically what I need is I need to create a CLI, okay? I need to create a CLI where I literally just do LK, which stands for license key, so LK new, right? LK new, I see this as like a totally separate Rust package, okay? I think we're getting somewhere here. So let's say that we created this license key package where the idea is I can create license keys, remove license keys, manage my license keys, associate them to any functions that I deem to be associated to, okay? Or really, it can be any keyword really, right? Because for example, let me just give you an example. I think functions as keywords should not be what we should be inputting, right? We should be inputting a name for that tier license, okay? It could be anything. Like for example, I could create a tier one license, right? So then when I call specific functions, I could use that key string tier one, and that would be associated to a specific license key. Does that make sense?”
02:12
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. What you’re describing is essentially a license management CLI tool that lets you create and manage different tiers or levels of licenses. Each tier or level is just a keyword that you associate with a set of functions. Then, when you generate a license key, you specify which tier it belongs to, and your Rust code can check that tier to see what’s allowed.

So basically, you’ll have a CLI that can do something like lk new --tier tier1 and it will generate a new license key for that tier. You’ll also have commands to remove or manage keys, and associate which functions or features belong to which tier.

In other words, you’re building a neat little utility that you’ll run on your side to generate and manage these keys. The client never sees this part; they just get a compiled DLL or library that checks their key against the tier they’ve been assigned. It’s a nice clean separation.

You said:
“Okay, so, but I just want to be able to also have the ability to have individual license keys now that are associated to the specific function called as well. So, we could have a license key called OrderBlock, right, and that would be specific to the OrderBlock function. It doesn't really matter what the name is as long as when that gets called within the function, right, we would use that the same name. I think within the function we still need the OrderBlock string, right, and then here's the way to do it. I think this is the way to do it. Every function, okay, when we do a check license, when we invoke the check license, we would provide the function name, okay, and then that function name gets mapped to either a tier or an individual license key.”
01:07
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that’s a solid plan. So basically, each function will just provide its own name when it calls the license checker. The license checker will then look up that function name and see if it matches either a tier license or an individual function-specific license.

In other words, your license management tool will have a mapping that says, "This function name can be accessed by these license keys, and this other function name can be accessed by these tiers or these individual keys."

That way, each function just says, "Hey, I’m the 'order_block' function, and I need to know if the current license key is allowed to run me." The license checker handles the rest and can differentiate between tier-based and individual function-based keys.

So yeah, it’s a flexible setup. You’ll have a CLI to manage and generate those keys and mappings, and then your functions just do a simple name-based lookup. It’ll keep things really clean and easy to maintain.

You said:
“Okay, so let's talk about the CLI, though. What I want to be able to do is I want to be able to create new licenses, okay? I want to be able to add function names, okay? So I may want to add, you know, four function names. And all this information could actually get stored back into a... I would just put it in an SQLite database, .db. I think Rust has packages that can connect to an SQLite database, correct?”
00:38
ChatGPT said:

Yes, absolutely! Rust has libraries like rusqlite that make it pretty straightforward to work with an SQLite database. So you can definitely store all your license keys, function names, and mappings in a local SQLite database. That’ll give you a nice persistent and easy-to-manage storage layer.

So for the CLI, you’ll have a few commands. For example, you could have lk new to create a new license key, and that command would let you specify a tier or an individual function name. You could have lk add-function to add new function names into the database and associate them with certain tiers or keys. And you could have lk remove or lk list to remove or list keys and their associated functions.

Basically, all the data is stored in SQLite, and your Rust CLI just reads and writes from that database. It’s definitely a practical approach and it keeps everything flexible and easy to update as you add more functions or more license tiers.

You said:
“So let's talk about the database. I think we would need, if I want to store, for example, I'm going to be able to basically add indicator or function names, right? So that's one thing that I'm going to be able to add is function names. The other thing that I'm going to be able to add is license keys, okay? So I want to be able to add and remove license keys. I want to be able to add and remove function names. Then I want to be able to associate a function name to one or more license keys or a license key to one or more function names. Is that the same thing? So how would you structure this entire table? Keep it minimal, simple, pragmatic.”
00:55
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, let’s keep it minimal and straightforward. We can set up just a few simple tables in the SQLite database to manage everything. Here’s a pragmatic way to structure it:

Table 1: functions

This table will store all the function or indicator names. It’s essentially a reference list of all the functions that can be protected by a license.

id (primary key): An integer ID for each function.

name: The name of the function (like "order_block").

Table 2: licenses

This table will store the license keys themselves. Each license key can be associated with a tier or an individual function.

id (primary key): An integer ID for each license.

key: The actual license key string.

tier: Optionally, the tier name (like "tier1"), or this can be null if it’s a function-specific license.

Table 3: license_function_map

This is a mapping table that links license keys to functions. It allows you to say "this particular license key can access these functions."

license_id: A foreign key that references the licenses table.

function_id: A foreign key that references the functions table.

With these three tables, you have a simple but powerful setup:

You can add and remove function names in the functions table.

You can add and remove license keys in the licenses table, and optionally associate them with a tier.

You can associate specific functions with specific license keys using the license_function_map table.

This gives you a minimal and pragmatic structure that’s easy to query and update. And yes, rusqlite will handle all the SQLite interactions smoothly, so you’ll have a nice lightweight database-driven CLI to manage it all.

You said:
“And then eventually I could port this database to the cloud, right?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! You can definitely start with SQLite locally and then later on port it to a cloud database if you need to. It’s pretty straightforward to migrate the schema and data to something like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or even a managed cloud database service.

Once it’s in the cloud, you can use a similar Rust library for the chosen database driver to connect and interact with it. That way, you get all the benefits of centralized storage, remote access, and easier scaling if you have multiple clients or need to manage licenses from different locations. So yeah, starting with SQLite locally is a great minimal step, and you’ve got the option to move to the cloud whenever you’re ready.

You said:
“Okay, so let's finish off our conversation. We did enough brainstorming. Provide a comprehensive overview of everything we've talked about. Provide a detailed plan of what needs to be implemented. And then I will hand this off to the AI planner. The AI planner will take our brainstorming session and create a very detailed specification plan with atomic and subatomic tasks, vision, and effects. This will then be handed off to an AI coder. The AI coder will implement the plan from start to end with my oversight.”
00:33
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, let’s wrap it up into a nice overview that you can hand off.

Comprehensive Overview

We started by discussing how to protect certain Rust functions or indicators so that they can only be used if a valid license key is provided. We explored a simple approach where each protected function calls a check_license function, which verifies whether the current license allows access to that particular function.

We then talked about structuring a minimalistic database using SQLite to store the mapping between functions and licenses. We decided on three tables: one for functions, one for licenses, and one mapping table to link them. This setup allows you to associate licenses either with tiers or with specific functions.

Finally, we discussed creating a command-line interface (CLI) tool in Rust to manage license keys. This CLI tool would allow you to create new licenses, add or remove function names, and associate licenses with functions. Initially, you can store all this information in SQLite locally, and later you can migrate to a cloud database for centralized access.

Detailed Implementation Plan

1. Define the Database Schema

Create the functions table to store function names.

Create the licenses table to store license keys and optional tiers.

Create the license_function_map table to link licenses to functions.

2. Implement the License Checker Module

Write a Rust module that includes the check_license function. This function will query the database to verify if a given function is allowed under the provided license key.

3. Protect the Indicator Functions

In each function that you want to protect, add a call to check_license and pass the function name. This way, each function checks if it’s accessible based on the current license.

4. Build the CLI Tool

Create a separate Rust binary (or subcommand) that lets you manage licenses. The CLI should allow you to:

Add and remove function names.

Generate new license keys and store them.

Associate functions with specific licenses or tiers.

Store all this data in the SQLite database.

5. Future Cloud Migration (Optional)

Plan for an optional step where you migrate the SQLite database to a cloud database like PostgreSQL. Adjust the database connection code in your Rust modules accordingly.

Vision and Objectives

The vision is to create a flexible, license-controlled framework for Rust-based indicators. The objective is to ensure that only licensed users can access certain functions, making it easy to manage and distribute protected code.

With that, you have a solid overview to pass on to the AI Planner. The planner will break it down further into atomic tasks, and then the AI Coder can implement it all step-by-step under your guidance. Let me know if you need anything else!
