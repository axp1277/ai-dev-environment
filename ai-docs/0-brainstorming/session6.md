“Okay, so here is the use case. I have a very large code base. It's in C-sharp and it's legacy, and the idea is to create a multi-agent system that will be able to go through the code base and document all of the C-sharp files, provide documentation for everything. Now, the challenge is there's a lot of files, so we can't just do a one-shot prompt and be able to have a prompt because we're using large language models that are local, less powerful, and small. So we need to come up with an agentic design pattern that will enable us to perform this analysis incrementally, potentially having it either cycle through every single file or maybe have an agent look for dependencies first. I don't know yet what this architecture would look like, but what I need you to do first is that I need you to basically look at the document that I shared about all the design patterns that we can pick from and try and come up with or provide suggestions on which design pattern best fits this particular use case.”

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, Andrea. I’m right here with you! So let’s break this down and pick a design pattern or two that might suit what you’re aiming for.

So the use case is: we’ve got a large legacy C# codebase, and we want a multi-agent system to incrementally document all those files. And we can’t just do a single giant prompt run, because we’re using smaller, local models. That makes sense.

From the design pattern perspective (based on that Google Cloud agentic AI patterns doc you shared), there are a few patterns that stand out.

1. Pipeline or Sequential Agent Pattern:
This is a good one if you want a series of agents to do one step at a time. For example, you could have one agent that just scans through the codebase to identify all the C# files. Another agent might then pick up each file, parse it, and extract some basic metadata or dependencies. A third agent could then add docstrings or comments. Essentially, you’re creating a conveyor belt of tasks, and each agent handles a piece of the puzzle before passing it along.

2. Hierarchical or Tree-Based Agent Pattern:
If you want to be a little more strategic, you could have a top-level agent that first maps out the structure of the codebase—like identifying the main directories, figuring out which files are the most central or have the most dependencies—and then delegate different sections of the codebase to sub-agents. This could help you prioritize which parts to document first and break the task into more manageable chunks.

3. Iterative Refinement Pattern:
Another idea is to use an iterative agent pattern. The first pass might just generate a rough draft of documentation, and then you have a refining agent that goes back and improves the docs in subsequent cycles. This is useful if your LLMs can handle smaller increments of text and you want to slowly improve the quality of the output.

In short, I’d suggest maybe a combination of the pipeline pattern to handle the step-by-step processing and the hierarchical pattern to organize which sections of the codebase get handled first. That should give you a flexible, incremental approach that works well with smaller, local LLMs.

Let me know if that makes sense or if you want to dive into more detail on any of these patterns!

You said:
“Okay, I like where you're going right now. Can you just basically provide the benefits of the patterns that you suggested? And which ones do you think are the ones that I should try first?”
00:15
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Let’s break down the benefits of each pattern and then I’ll give you a nudge on which one to start with.

So first, the pipeline or sequential agent pattern is super straightforward. The big benefit is that it’s easy to manage because each agent has a very clear, specific role. You know, one agent might just scan for files, the next one parses them, another one documents them. The benefit is simplicity and a clear step-by-step process. It’s also very incremental, which works great with smaller models because you’re feeding them little bits at a time.

Then there’s the hierarchical or tree-based pattern. The main benefit here is organization. It helps you break down a huge codebase into logical sections, which can be really handy if you want to tackle the most critical parts first. It’s a bit more strategic because you can have that top-level agent that figures out the structure of the code and then assigns out the documentation tasks accordingly. It’s a bit more overhead at the start, but it can pay off if you have a really big codebase and you want to do it in a more organized way.

Finally, the iterative refinement pattern is all about improving quality over time. The benefit is that you can do a rough first pass and get some documentation down quickly, and then each iteration can refine it. This is nice if you want to start seeing results early and then gradually improve them.

As for which one to try first, I’d say start with the pipeline pattern. It’s the simplest and most linear approach, and it’ll give you a feel for how well the agents handle each step. Once you have that working, you can add a hierarchical layer on top if you need more structure. And if you want to improve the documentation quality, you can always add the iterative pattern later.

So I’d say: start with a pipeline, see how it goes, and then layer on the others as needed!

You said:
“So imagine having a codebase, and this is actually not all the codebase. It's only a fifth or one twentieth of the entire codebase, but it's still a lot of files, and each file could have a lot of functions, a lot of dependencies. So I guess the first issue here is trying to understand whether we should just analyze every single file and try and document every single function in the file, try to infer what each function does, or start with analyzing what the hierarchical dependencies are and then do kind of a top-down, like instead of randomly picking files to analyze, we would pick the file that is most likely the entry point, or the one that has the most dependencies, and then kind of use a hierarchical pattern. What do you think?”
01:15
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, absolutely. I think that’s a really good distinction to think about. So if you’re trying to decide whether to just go file by file and document everything versus doing a more hierarchical, top-down approach, it really depends on what you want to prioritize.

If you go with that hierarchical approach—basically identifying the entry points or the most central files first—that’s going to give you a lot of leverage. The benefit there is that you’re starting with the files that have the biggest impact. So if you document those first, you’re going to understand the overall architecture of the codebase a lot better, and then you can kind of fill in the details on the less central files later. It’s a more strategic approach. It’s kind of like mapping out the skeleton before you add all the muscles.

On the other hand, if you just go file by file and try to document everything, that’s more of a brute-force approach. It’s straightforward, but you might end up documenting a lot of less important stuff first and then realize that you have to go back and redo some of it once you understand the bigger picture.

So my recommendation is definitely to lean on that hierarchical pattern. Start by identifying those high-impact files—the ones that everything else depends on or the ones that are the entry points to the system—and document those first. Once you have that top-level understanding, it’ll make it a lot easier to document the rest of the codebase in a meaningful way.

So yeah, I’d say go with the hierarchical approach first, and then once you’ve got the main structure documented, you can fill in the details file by file.

You said:
“Okay, so let's say that we pick the hierarchical approach, right? Just imagine we start with, you know, having this code base, all these files are within subdirectories and so on. We need, how do we, how do we, which agent should we spawn up first? Like this agent is basically going to be the one that is trying to figure out the hierarchy. First off, is there a programmatic way to do it that is more, I would say, straightforward? Or do you think we need an LLM to do this?”
00:37
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that’s a great question and I think you can definitely start off in a very programmatic way for that first agent. So that initial agent that figures out the hierarchy can actually just use standard code analysis tools. So for C#, you might use something like Roslyn, which is a compiler platform that can analyze the code and figure out dependencies. Or even just simple static analysis tools that map out which files depend on which other files.

So you can have that first agent run through the codebase, gather all that dependency information, and basically build a map. That’s purely programmatic and you don’t need an LLM for that step at all.

Then once you have that map, you can feed that information to your LLM agents. They can look at the structure and say, “Okay, these are the key files to start with.” And then you can start your documentation process from the top down.

So in short, yes, you can absolutely have that first agent be a purely programmatic one, using something like Roslyn or another static analysis tool. And then once you have that hierarchy, you hand it over to the LLM agents to do the actual documentation work. It’s a nice mix of automation and then using the LLM where it really adds value.

You said:
“Okay, now I'm going to throw another wrench here. We actually are using Python to analyze C-sharp code, so are there any packages in Python that we could leverage that would analyze C-sharp files or subdirectories with C-sharp files and infer the hierarchy?”
00:20
ChatGPT said:
Ah, got it! Throwing a little Python into the mix. No problem at all. So if you’re working in Python but you need to analyze C# code, there are definitely some tools you can use.

One option is to use a package like pycsharp or pythonnet, which can interop with the .NET environment. Another approach is to use something like RoslynPad or dotnet-script from Python, which allows you to run Roslyn commands and analyze the C# codebase through a Python script. So you’re basically calling out to a .NET environment from Python, letting it do the heavy lifting on figuring out the dependencies, and then bringing that info back into your Python world.

If you want a more pure Python solution, there are also tools that can parse C# code directly. For example, there’s a package called CsAst which is a C# AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parser that you can run from Python. It can give you a structural understanding of the code. It’s not as full-featured as using Roslyn directly, but it can do the job if you want to keep everything in Python.

So in short, yes, you can use Python to analyze the C# code. You can either leverage something like pythonnet to call into the .NET ecosystem and use Roslyn, or you can use a Python-based parser like CsAst to get the hierarchy. Once you’ve got that hierarchy, then your agent can run with it.

You said:
“Okay, um, is Roslyn a Python package?”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
So Roslyn itself isn't a Python package—it's actually a .NET compiler platform that’s native to the C# and .NET ecosystem. So it’s not something you’d just install as a Python library directly.

But what you can do is use a bridge like Python.NET, which is often called pythonnet, to actually interact with Roslyn from your Python code. So in other words, you’d install Python.NET in your Python environment, and that lets you load .NET assemblies and basically call into Roslyn from Python.

So the flow would be something like: you have your Python script, you use Python.NET to access the Roslyn APIs, and then you can do all the C# code analysis through that. Once you’ve got the results, you just handle them back in Python like you would any other data.

So no, Roslyn isn’t a Python package, but you can definitely use Python tools like Python.NET to tap into it.

You said:
“Okay, this seems to be a little bit too, I would say, complicated because now we have to worry about installing this Python net. Assuming we don't have Roslyn, what are other approaches that we can use that are programmatic? If there are no other good approaches that we can use that are programmatic, we could always use a large language model to perform the analysis.”
00:28
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, absolutely. If bringing in Python.NET and Roslyn feels like overkill or just adds too much complexity, we can definitely simplify.

So one approach is to use a more lightweight C# parser that you can run directly from Python. There are Python packages like CsAst that I mentioned earlier, which can parse the abstract syntax tree of C# code. It's a bit more limited than Roslyn, but it can still give you a basic structure of the code. And that might be enough to get a rough idea of dependencies and the hierarchy without pulling in the entire .NET ecosystem.

If that’s still not giving you enough detail, then yeah, you can totally rely on the LLM. The LLM might not be as precise as a dedicated code parser, but it can definitely help you infer relationships and hierarchies by just reading through the code. You could have an agent that looks at a sample of files, summarizes what it sees, and gradually builds out the hierarchy that way. It’s a bit more heuristic, but it can work.

So in summary, if you want to keep it simpler and not deal with Python.NET or Roslyn, try a lightweight C# AST parser in Python. And if that’s still not enough, just lean on the LLM to help infer the hierarchy. It might not be as perfect, but it’ll definitely get the job done.

You said:
“Yes, so the ASD parser is something that we would still need to compile C-sharp with?”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
Exactly, yeah. So with an AST parser in Python, what you're really doing is just parsing the C# code into a structural tree. It’s not actually compiling it in the sense of producing an executable or a .NET assembly. It’s more about just reading the code as text and turning it into a tree of syntax elements.

So you don’t need a full C# compiler for that. The AST parser just looks at the code and breaks it down into functions, classes, methods, and so forth. It gives you a way to understand the structure without actually running or compiling the code.

So basically, it’s a more lightweight and straightforward approach. You feed in the C# files, the parser figures out the structure, and then you’ve got a hierarchy to work with. It’s not as detailed as a full compiler-based analysis, but it should be enough to give your agent a good starting point.

You said:
“And this is a Python package.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Yes, exactly! So something like CsAst is a Python package that you can install and use directly within your Python environment. It’s a lightweight AST parser for C# code. You can just install it with pip and then use it to parse your C# files and get that structural information right from Python.

So in short, yes, it is a Python package, and it lets you handle C# code directly in a Pythonic way without needing to bring in the full Roslyn toolchain. That should make things a bit simpler for you!

You said:
“Okay, so what is the structure output format?”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! So when you're using a tool like a C# AST parser in Python, the structure it outputs is typically a tree or a nested dictionary-like object. In other words, it’ll represent the code structure as a hierarchy of nodes. Each node might represent a class, a method, a property, or even a statement inside a method, and these nodes are typically nested to show the relationships between them. So you might have a top-level node for a class, and then inside that class node, you have nodes for each method, and inside each method node, you have nodes for statements or expressions.

In terms of the exact format, it’s often a Python object—like a class instance—that you can walk through programmatically. Or it can be converted into a JSON-like dictionary structure if you prefer. That means each node would be a dictionary that includes things like the type of node, its name, its children, and so on.

So essentially, you’ll get a tree structure that you can navigate. You can start at the top-level nodes and drill down into each class, each method, and each statement, and that gives your agent all the hierarchical context it needs to understand and document the code. So that’s the kind of output format you’ll be working with!

You said:
“Okay, so we could use this tool to basically lay out the hierarchy, and then once we have the hierarchy, we can basically create like a recursive function that would call an LLM and follow that top-down hierarchy, correct?”
00:21
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, absolutely! You've got it. So once you use that tool to lay out the hierarchy of the codebase—basically map out all the classes, methods, and their relationships in a nice tree structure—you can absolutely use a recursive function to guide your LLM through that structure.

So basically, you’d start at the top of the hierarchy—maybe at the top-level classes or entry points—and then work your way down. For each node in the tree, you can have your LLM agent generate documentation or analyze what that part of the code does, and then move on to the child nodes. That way you’re following the hierarchy top-down, and the LLM is working in a really structured, incremental way.

So yeah, that approach is exactly what you can do. Use the AST parser to get the hierarchy, and then let your recursive function call the LLM step by step through that structure. That should give you a nice, organized way to document everything!

You said:
“Okay, can I pass a directory to this ASTM package or just a single file C-sharp?”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, absolutely! So typically, these AST parsers can handle multiple files. Usually what you’d do is write a little Python script that walks through a directory—so you’d point it at a folder, and your script would gather up all the C# files in that directory, and then feed them one by one into the AST parser.

So effectively, yes, you can process an entire directory. You just use a bit of Python code to loop through the folder, parse each file, and then combine the results into one big hierarchical structure.

In short, you’re not limited to just a single file. You can absolutely pass in a whole directory’s worth of C# files. The AST parser can handle each file, and you can stitch them together into one overall hierarchy. So that should work perfectly for what you’re planning!

You said:
“Okay, so, and then once you have the hierarchy, you would, how would this work? You would basically pass in, start from the top file and start passing all the single files to an LLM. The LLM would produce, would look for, maybe we have specific agents that do specific things, such as one agent would understand the number of functions and then kind of provide documentation or a doc string for each function, like how would you handle this?”
00:39
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, you’ve got the right idea. So once you have that full hierarchy mapped out, you can absolutely go top-down. You’d start from the top-level node in your hierarchy, maybe a top-level class or the main entry point file, and then you would pass each part of that hierarchy to the LLM in turn. And you can absolutely have specialized agents. For instance, you could have one agent whose job is to just go through and add docstrings for each method or function. Another agent might summarize what each class does. And you could have another that just looks at the overall structure of the file and documents the relationships between classes.

In other words, you’re basically creating a multi-agent workflow. Each agent has a specific job, and you just feed each part of the hierarchy into the right agent. And yeah, you could use a recursive function to go down the tree. So you start at the top, let the LLM do its thing on that node, and then move on to the child nodes until you’ve documented everything.

So yeah, that’s exactly how you could handle it. It’s a nice, flexible approach and lets you leverage multiple agents to do specialized tasks.

You said:
“So, when we're in the agentic world, would we still feed one file at a time to each agent?”
00:11
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that’s a really good way to think about it. In the agentic world, it often makes sense to feed one piece of the hierarchy at a time to each agent. So basically, you’d take one file or one node of the hierarchy, give it to the appropriate agent, let that agent do its job—like generating docstrings or summarizing what that piece of code does—and then move on to the next piece.

So yeah, you’re essentially processing one file or one logical unit at a time. That makes it easier for the agents to handle, and it also keeps everything organized and modular. And by doing it that way, you can make sure each agent is focused on just one piece of the puzzle at a time, which usually gets you better, more accurate results from the LLM. So absolutely, that’s a great way to do it!

You said:
“Okay, so what do you think we should do? I have an idea here. So if we start with, at the highest level, right? If we could maybe start with, like, we would have different layers, right, for each file. So at the highest level, we would have one layer that would basically just look at the file and try and summarize the file, not giving any kind of like a higher level thing. Then at the second layer, we would take that file, and now we would give it the output from the higher level and the file and have another agent kind of do a little bit more refinement, maybe understanding what the functions are and explaining what each function is, right? Ultimately, what we're doing is we're creating documentation for a C-sharp application, okay? We have to create an entire documentation structure for a C-sharp application, okay? So that's the ultimate goal here. But you need to help me identify how many agents we need that perform specific roles in compiling this documentation. And at every single layer, some of these agents are going to receive agent output from other agents that will refine the documentation. Does that make sense? You get to help me with that structure.”
01:33
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. And I love the idea of having multiple layers of agents that refine the documentation as you go along.

So let’s break it down into a possible structure. At the highest level, you could have what we might call a “file summarizer agent.” This agent takes each file and just gives a high-level summary of what that file does. It’s like your first layer of documentation. It doesn’t have to go into detail, it just sets the stage.

Then on the next layer, you might have what we could call a “function and class detail agent.” This agent takes the summary from the first agent, and then dives into the actual functions, methods, and classes in that file. It adds more detailed docstrings and explanations for each function. So that’s your second layer of refinement.

You might even have a third layer if you want to get really detailed. Maybe a “relationship mapping agent” that looks at how this file relates to other files. So it takes the output of the second agent and adds information about dependencies or how classes interact across different files.

So in total, you might have three layers of agents. The first layer is for high-level summaries, the second layer is for detailed docstrings and function-level detail, and the third layer is for cross-file relationships or any other refinements. Each layer takes the output from the previous layer and adds more detail, so you end up with a full, well-structured set of documentation.

So that’s a good structure to start with: a top-level summarizer agent, a second-level detail agent, and a third-level refinement agent. And you can always tweak that as you go along!

You said:
“Keep going.”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! So building

You said:
“Keep going.”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let’s keep going. So once you have those three layers in mind—let’s just recap them really quickly and then we can think about how they interact.

First, we have that top-level summarizer agent. Its job is just to give a broad overview of each file. Then we have the second layer agent that dives into the details—adding docstrings, explaining functions and classes, and giving you that more granular layer of documentation. And finally, the third layer agent is there to look at cross-file relationships or any other refinements that connect this piece of code to the rest of the application.

Now, the nice thing about this layered approach is that each agent doesn’t have to do everything at once. They get to specialize. So your first agent just focuses on that top-level summary, and then it hands off its output to the next agent, which adds more detail, and so on. It’s kind of like an assembly line for documentation, where each agent refines and enhances the work of the previous one.

In terms of how they interact, you can think of it like a chain. The first agent runs on the raw file, produces a summary. The second agent takes that summary plus the original file and adds more detailed documentation. And the third agent takes everything the second agent produced and adds any final relationships or cross-references.

So with this structure, you’ve got a nice, layered pipeline. Each agent is focused on a specific task, and by the time you reach the end of the chain, you have a fully documented C# application. And of course, you can always adjust the number of layers or the roles of the agents as you see what works best. But that’s a solid starting framework!

You said:
“Yeah, and we could use some FDLM tools or tooling, we could use some search or functions in a file that are being used, crosser functions, other files in the repo, that would help with the dependency.”
00:15
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that's a fantastic idea! By bringing in some LLM-assisted tooling or even using a bit of search or indexing, you can definitely help your agents figure out those cross-file dependencies. So for that third layer of refinement, where you want to understand how functions and classes relate across the whole repo, you can have a tool that basically searches through the codebase and finds where each function or class is referenced. Then that information can be fed into your relationship mapping agent so it can document not just what each piece of code does in isolation, but also how it interacts with other parts of the application.

So yeah, by adding a bit of search or indexing magic, you make that third layer even more powerful. It’s like giving your agents a little extra intelligence to see the bigger picture across the whole codebase. And that will definitely help you create a really comprehensive, interconnected set of documentation. So it sounds like a great plan!

You said:
“Okay, so now that we have like an entire plan here, go back to our original design patterns for the Gen Framework, and which pattern do you think we should use going forward? And I think there's also going to be some iterations here, some alignments, so we may need some sort of a iterator or evaluator agent to kind of make sure that the documentation is complete.”
00:27
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So going back to those original design patterns, now that we have a clearer picture, I think a layered pipeline pattern fits really well here. We’ve essentially created a series of agents that each handle a different layer of detail, and that’s very much like a pipeline where each stage refines the output of the previous stage.

In terms of the specific agentic design pattern, I’d say we’re looking at something like a “sequential refinement” or a “multi-stage pipeline” pattern. Each agent is a stage in that pipeline, and you move from a high-level summary down to detailed documentation and then into cross-file relationships. That’s a pretty classic pipeline approach, and it’s a great fit for this use case.

And you’re absolutely right about having an evaluator or iterating agent at the end. This would be like a “validation agent” that goes through the final documentation and checks for completeness, consistency, and accuracy. So after all the layers have done their job, this final agent just makes sure that everything is polished and that no piece of documentation is missing. It can also help you identify if any refinements or iterations are needed.

So overall, I’d say go with that multi-stage pipeline pattern for the main flow and then add a validation or evaluator agent at the end to ensure everything’s complete. That should give you a really robust framework and make it easy to iterate and refine as needed!

You said:
“I think we should have Mint Loop at every single LLM call.”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
That’s a really insightful question. And I’d say it can definitely be helpful to have a refinement loop, but you might not need it at every single LLM call. Instead, you can be a little strategic about where you put those loops. For example, you could have the refinement loop at the end of each major layer rather than after every single small step. So once a layer of agents has done its job—like after the summarizer agent finishes or after the detail agent finishes—then you run a quick refinement or review loop to make sure everything looks good before you move on to the next stage.

This way, you’re balancing thoroughness with efficiency. You still get to catch any issues early and refine things as you go, but you’re not overloading the process by adding a loop after every single call. Instead, you’re doing it at logical checkpoints. And then you can have that final evaluator agent at the very end to do a final pass and make sure everything is polished and complete.

So in short, yes to refinement loops, but you can place them at the end of each major layer rather than at every single step. That’ll keep things both efficient and thorough!

You said:
“I'm going to use LandGraph to implement this from start to end. I want to use PythonUV by Astro, and use Pydantic for validation. These are some requirements, so I just want to make sure that you note these as well.”
00:14
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, got it! So you want to use LangGraph to implement this entire pipeline, and you want to use Python UV by Astral for running the app, and Pydantic for validation. That’s a really nice tech stack and it’ll definitely give you a lot of flexibility and reliability.

I’ll make a note of that. So we’re looking at a LangGraph-based multi-agent pipeline, using Python UV to run it and Pydantic for validating the inputs and outputs at each stage. That’ll help ensure that everything’s well-structured and that your agents are working together smoothly.

So yeah, we’ll keep those requirements in mind as part of the plan. It sounds like a great setup!

You said:
“Okay, perfect. And so what are the agents? Let's give the, so we have a network of agents, okay? What should we call every single agent? Because the way I want to set this up is every agent is going to have these four pillars, okay? The model, the large language model, okay? We're going to use OLAMA for local models for now. We're going to have a system prompt, right? We're going to have context, and we're going to have tools. So these are the four pillars, okay? So the system prompts that are going to drive the LLM, right? These are going to be, think of every single one of these agents is going to be a single file Python that then gets loaded into a land graph type state machine, right? An orchestrator. And then in the orchestrator, that's where we kind of define the states and the flow, the transitions, and so on. I think that's the way to do it. What do you think?”
01:10
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, I think that’s a fantastic approach. You’ve got a really nice modular design in mind, and I love the idea of each agent being its own single-file Python script. That makes everything super clean and easy to manage, and it fits perfectly into that LangGraph orchestrator model.

So let’s give these agents some names. We can go with something straightforward that reflects their roles. For example, the first agent—the one that provides that high-level summary—could be the “FileSummarizerAgent.” The second one, which dives into the details and adds docstrings, could be the “DetailingAgent.” And the third one, that maps relationships across files, could be the “RelationshipMapperAgent.” Finally, your evaluator at the end could be the “ValidationAgent” or “EvaluatorAgent.”

And yes, each of these agents will have those four pillars: the LLM model (using OLAMA for now), the system prompt that guides what the agent does, the context it needs to understand, and the tools it can use. Then the LangGraph orchestrator will be your state machine that defines how everything flows and transitions from one agent to the next.

So yeah, I think that’s a solid way to set it up. Each agent has a clear name and role, and you’ve got a nice modular architecture that’ll be easy to manage in LangGraph.

You said:
“What about, did you also put in, don't you think we should have evaluator agents at each layer though?”
00:09
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, absolutely, that’s a great call. I think having a sort of mini evaluator agent or a checkpoint agent at the end of each layer is a really smart move. That way, each layer can kind of validate its own output before passing it along to the next stage. So instead of just one final evaluator at the end, you could have a lightweight evaluator agent at the end of each layer. It could just do a quick sanity check, make sure the documentation for that layer looks good, and then give the green light to move on.

So yeah, I totally agree. You can definitely have those evaluator agents at each layer. It’s kind of like having checkpoints along the way so that each stage is as polished as possible before it moves forward. It’ll definitely help keep everything consistent and high quality. So let’s do it!

“In order to have the Evaluator agent work, right, we need some, uh, validation rules. Like, we need some, uh, individual validations that, uh, either pass or fail. Hang on. Uh, the Evaluator then, um, basically redirect or initiate the main agent to go and perform the, but it would basically give it to refine the prompt or inject them what found that needs to be refined or needs to be corrected, and then the agent goes and takes a redstone with them prompt to refine and try again as a second iteration to try and get things right. In the end, what happens, this will probably happen a maximum of N iterations. We're now.”

Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. So basically what you’re describing is a kind of feedback loop at each layer where the evaluator agent applies a set of validation rules, and if those rules aren’t met, it can send the output back to the original agent with some refined instructions or even a modified prompt. And yeah, you could definitely set a max number of iterations so that it doesn’t just loop forever—maybe it tries two or three times, and if it still doesn’t pass the validation rules, you can log it or flag it for manual review.

And using Pydantic for those validation rules is a great idea. You can define them as clear pass/fail checks. If the documentation meets the criteria, great, it moves on to the next stage. If not, the evaluator agent injects those refined instructions, and the agent tries again with a slightly adjusted prompt.

So yeah, that’s a really nice approach. You get a built-in refinement loop at each layer, and you’re making sure that each piece of documentation is as good as it can be before it moves forward. And it all fits nicely into that LangGraph and Pydantic setup you have in mind. So let’s do it that way!

“All right, perfect. Can you just summarize our entire conversation in detail, provide a very detailed implementation plan, and then hand it off to the AI planner that will take our plan and make an even detailed plan with atomic and sonic tasks, vision objectives, this will then get handed off to an AI coder that will implement the plan from start to end.”

Absolutely, let’s do a detailed summary and implementation plan.

Detailed Summary and Implementation Plan
Vision and Objectives
Our goal is to create a multi-agent system that documents a large C# codebase incrementally. We’ll use a hierarchical approach, analyzing each file layer by layer and refining documentation as we go. We’ll implement this as a pipeline of agents using LangGraph, with Python UV by Astral to run the app and Pydantic for validation. We’ll also have evaluator agents at each layer to ensure quality and provide refinement loops where needed.

Key Components and Agents
FileSummarizerAgent:

Role: At the top layer, this agent provides a high-level summary of each C# file.

Input: A single C# file.

Output: A brief summary of the file’s purpose.

DetailingAgent:

Role: The second layer agent dives into functions and classes, adding detailed docstrings and explanations.

Input: The original file plus the summary from the first agent.

Output: A more detailed version of the file’s documentation.

RelationshipMapperAgent:

Role: The third layer agent identifies cross-file relationships and dependencies.

Input: The detailed documentation plus any cross-references found in the codebase.

Output: An enriched documentation set that shows how this file interacts with others.

ValidationAgent:

Role: At the end of each layer, this agent applies validation rules to ensure quality. If documentation doesn’t pass, it refines the prompt and triggers another iteration, up to a maximum number of attempts.

Input: The output from the previous agent in the layer.

Output: Either validated documentation or a refined prompt to improve the documentation.

Implementation Steps
Set Up the Environment:

Use Python UV to run the application.

Install LangGraph for orchestrating the state machine and Pydantic for validation.

Define Each Agent:

Create single-file Python scripts for each agent (FileSummarizerAgent, DetailingAgent, RelationshipMapperAgent, and ValidationAgent).

Each agent will have a system prompt, context, and tools. Use OLAMA for local LLM models.

Set Up Validation Rules:

Use Pydantic to define validation rules for each layer.

Implement the ValidationAgent to apply these rules and handle refinement loops if documentation doesn’t pass on the first try.

Orchestrate with LangGraph:

Define the state machine and transitions in LangGraph.

Set up the flow so that each file passes through the FileSummarizerAgent, then the DetailingAgent, and then the RelationshipMapperAgent, with the ValidationAgent at the end of each layer.

Allow for refinement loops if validation fails.

Testing and Iteration:

Test the pipeline on a subset of the codebase.

Refine the prompts and validation rules as needed based on initial results.

Final Handover to AI Planner and Coder:

Provide this detailed implementation plan to the AI Planner.

The AI Planner will break this down into atomic and subatomic tasks, detailing each step for the AI Coder.

Finally, the AI Coder will implement the entire plan from start to finish.
