# Epic 5: Incremental Documentation Updates

**Epic Goal**: Enable efficient documentation updates as code changes without regenerating the entire documentation set

## User Story 5.1: Detect Changed Files

**As a** DevOps Engineer (Priya)
**I want to** automatically detect which C# files have changed since the last documentation run
**So that** I can update only affected documentation without processing the entire codebase

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Given documentation was previously generated, when I run an incremental update, then the system identifies files modified since the last run
- [ ] Given files are detected, when I review the list, then I see file paths and modification timestamps
- [ ] Given I want to force regeneration, when I specify files or patterns, then those files are documented regardless of modification status
- [ ] Given no files have changed, when I run incremental update, then the system reports "no changes detected" and exits

**Priority**: Medium
**Story Points**: 3

**So that** agents transition correctly between layers with proper state management

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Given the pipeline is defined, when I review the LangGraph configuration, then I see states for each agent layer (Summarizer, Detailing, RelationshipMapper, Validation)
- [ ] Given states are defined, when the pipeline runs, then transitions occur only after successful completion or max iterations
- [ ] Given validation fails, when refinement is triggered, then state transitions back to the appropriate agent with refined context
- [ ] Given the state machine is complete, when I visualize it, then I can see the full workflow including loops and branches

**Priority**: High
**Story Points**: 8

---

## User Story 6.2: Implement Specialized Agents

**As a** Senior Developer (Marcus) implementing the system
**I want to** implement each agent as a single Python file with the four pillars (model, prompt, context, tools)
**So that** agents are modular, maintainable, and easy to customize

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Given each agent is implemented, when I review the code, then I see clear separation of model configuration, system prompt, context handling, and tools
- [ ] Given an agent needs customization, when I modify the system prompt file, then the agent uses the updated prompt without code changes
- [ ] Given agents are modular, when I want to test one agent, then I can run it independently without running the entire pipeline
- [ ] Given the agents are complete, when I review the architecture, then FileSummarizerAgent, DetailingAgent, RelationshipMapperAgent, and ValidationAgent all exist
