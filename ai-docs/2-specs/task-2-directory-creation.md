# Task 2.0 Directory Creation and Reorganization - Complete
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Specification:** specs-4.md - AI Development Workflow Enhancement System
**Status:** ✓ COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

Successfully created missing directories and reorganized the ai-docs structure for optimal logical grouping. All planning documents are now properly organized in Layer 2, with clear separation between source materials (Layer 0) and processed documents (Layers 1-2).

## Actions Taken

### Phase 1: Initial Directory Creation (Later Revised)
- Created `3-user-stories/` (temporary)
- Created `6-acceptance-criteria/` (temporary)
- Created `7-diagrams/` (temporary)

### Phase 2: Structure Reorganization (User-Driven Improvement)
**Rationale:** All planning documents should be grouped together in Layer 2 for logical consistency.

**Removed Redundant Directories:**
- Deleted empty `2-prds/` (duplicate)
- Deleted empty `2-meeting-minutes/` (to be reorganized)
- Deleted temporary `3-user-stories/`, `6-acceptance-criteria/`, `7-diagrams/`

**Created Proper Layer 2 Planning Directories:**
- `2-prds/` - Moved from `1-prds/` (contains prd2.md, prd3.md)
- `2-user-stories/` - For user story documents
- `2-validation/` - For acceptance criteria and validation documents
- `2-diagrams/` - For Mermaid workflow and architecture diagrams

**Created Layer 1 Directory:**
- `1-meeting-minutes/` - Renamed from `2-meeting-minutes/`

**Created Additional Layer 0 Directory:**
- `0-voice/` - For voice transcript notes

## Directory Permissions

All new directories created with standard permissions:
- **Permissions:** 755 (drwxr-xr-x)
- **Owner:** Andrea
- **Group:** Andrea

## Updated Naming Conventions

```
Layer 0: Source Material
  - Brainstorming:  session-N.md (or sessionN.md for legacy)
  - Voice:          voice-N.md
  - Meetings:       meeting-N.md
  - Emails:         email-N.md

Layer 1: Processed Notes
  - Meeting Notes:  minutes-N.md

Layer 2: Planning Documents
  - PRDs:           prdN.md
  - Specs:          specs-N.md
  - User Stories:   stories-N.md
  - Validation:     validation-N.md
  - Diagrams:       workflow-N.mmd, architecture-N.mmd
```

## Design Philosophy

### Layered Architecture Benefits

**Layer 0 - Source Material:**
- Contains unprocessed, raw input
- Multiple input types (voice, text, meetings, emails)
- Serves as the single source of truth for original discussions

**Layer 1 - Processed Notes:**
- Structured notes extracted from Layer 0
- Meeting minutes summarize meeting content
- Bridge between raw input and planning

**Layer 2 - Planning Documents:**
- **Critical Design Decision:** All planning documents grouped together
- Enables easy access to complete planning picture
- PRDs, specs, stories, validation, and diagrams all in one logical layer
- Facilitates the `/plan` command to generate all Layer 2 documents

**Layers 3-5 - Support Structure:**
- Resources, reusable components, workflows
- Supporting infrastructure for the planning and development process

## Impact on Implementation

### Simplified Document Generation Flow

```
/plan <N> command flow:
1. Read: 0-brainstorming/session-N.md
2. Generate → 2-prds/prdN.md
3. Generate → 2-user-stories/stories-N.md
4. Generate → 2-specs/specs-N.md
5. Generate → 2-validation/validation-N.md
6. Generate → 2-diagrams/{workflow,architecture}-N.mmd
```

All outputs go to Layer 2, making it the complete planning layer.

### Context Loading with /prime

```
/prime <N> command flow:
1. Read: 0-brainstorming/session-N.md (source)
2. Read: 2-prds/prdN.md (planning)
3. Read: 2-user-stories/stories-N.md (planning)
4. Read: 2-specs/specs-N.md (planning)
5. Read: 2-validation/validation-N.md (planning)
6. Read: 2-diagrams/*.mmd (planning)
```

All planning context loaded from Layer 2.

## Verification

### Directory Creation Verified
```bash
$ ls -ld ai-docs/0-voice
drwxr-xr-x - Andrea 13 Oct 21:26 ai-docs/0-voice

$ ls -ld ai-docs/1-meeting-minutes
drwxr-xr-x - Andrea 13 Oct 21:25 ai-docs/1-meeting-minutes

$ ls -ld ai-docs/2-*/
drwxr-xr-x - Andrea 13 Oct 21:23 ai-docs/2-diagrams
drwxr-xr-x - Andrea 17 Sep 08:17 ai-docs/2-prds
drwxr-xr-x - Andrea 13 Oct 21:23 ai-docs/2-specs
drwxr-xr-x - Andrea 13 Oct 21:22 ai-docs/2-user-stories
drwxr-xr-x - Andrea 13 Oct 21:22 ai-docs/2-validation
```

### Content Preservation Verified
```bash
$ ls ai-docs/2-prds/
prd2.md  prd3.md  # Successfully moved from 1-prds
```

## Next Steps

**Ready for Task 3.0:** Design Codebase Researcher Sub-Agent

The directory structure is now properly organized and ready for:
- Prompt file creation (Tasks 4-6)
- Command file creation (Tasks 7-8)
- Implementation and testing (Tasks 9-14)

## Lessons Learned

1. **User Input is Valuable:** The reorganization from scattered numbering (3, 6, 7) to unified Layer 2 (all 2-*) significantly improves logical coherence.

2. **Layered Architecture:** Organizing by document lifecycle (source → processed → planning) is more intuitive than arbitrary numbering.

3. **Consolidation:** Moving PRDs from Layer 1 to Layer 2 makes sense - PRDs are planning documents, not just processed notes.

4. **Flexibility:** Being willing to reorganize during implementation leads to better long-term structure.

## Conclusion

Task 2.0 successfully completed with user-driven improvements that significantly enhanced the directory structure's logical organization. All planning documents are now unified in Layer 2, providing a clear, consistent structure for the document generation workflow.

**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE AND IMPROVED
