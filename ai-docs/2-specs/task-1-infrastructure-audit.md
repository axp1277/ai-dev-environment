# Task 1.0 Infrastructure Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Specification:** specs-4.md - AI Development Workflow Enhancement System
**Status:** ✓ COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

Completed comprehensive audit of existing AI-docs infrastructure and .claude directory structure. All required base components exist, with three missing directories identified for creation in Task 2.0.

## Findings

### 1.1: AI-Docs Directory Structure ✓

**Status:** VERIFIED - All base directories exist

**Existing Directories:**
- `0-brainstorming/` - Contains brainstorming session transcripts
- `0-emails/` - Additional email documentation
- `0-meetings/` - Meeting notes
- `1-prds/` - Product requirement documents
- `2-specs/` - Technical specification documents
- `2-meeting-minutes/` - Meeting minutes archive
- `2-prds/` - Legacy PRD location
- `3-resources/` - Resource files
- `4-prompts/` - Prompt templates for document generation
- `4-misc/` - Miscellaneous files
- `5-workflows/` - Workflow documentation
- `5-issues/` - Issue tracking

**Note:** Directory structure has evolved organically with some numbering overlap (e.g., two "2-" directories, two "4-" directories). Current structure is functional but could benefit from reorganization in future optimization.

### 1.2: Required Prompt Files ✓

**Status:** VERIFIED - All required prompts exist

**Found in `/ai-docs/4-prompts/`:**
- ✓ `brain2specs.md` (6.1k) - Converts brainstorming to technical specifications
- ✓ `session-to-prd.md` (7.0k) - Converts sessions to PRDs (brain2prd equivalent)
- `transcript2minutes.md` (4.1k) - Meeting transcript processor
- `coder-minimalist-agent.md` (2.1k) - Minimalist coding agent prompt
- `unified_coding_standards.md` (4.6k) - Coding standards reference

**Note:** The brain2prd prompt is named `session-to-prd.md` instead of `brain2prd.md`, but serves the same purpose.

### 1.3: Claude Command Files ✓

**Status:** VERIFIED - Command directory exists with multiple commands

**Found in `/.claude/commands/` (17 files):**

Existing relevant commands:
- ✓ `brain2specs.md` (243 bytes) - Already implemented
- ✓ `session2prd.md` (3.8k) - PRD generation command
- ✓ `prime.md` (3.6k) - Context loading command (ALREADY EXISTS!)
- `workflow.md` (4.0k) - Workflow execution
- `implement.md` (2.5k) - Implementation helper
- `document.md` (2.6k) - Documentation generator
- `gac.md` (5.3k) - Git add/commit workflow
- `gacp.md` (3.9k) - Git add/commit/push workflow
- `meet2plan.md` (639 bytes) - Meeting to plan converter
- `mergebrain2specs.md` (1.2k) - Merge brain to specs
- `setup.md` (4.1k) - Project setup
- `start.md` (1.1k) - Session starter
- `update_completion.md` (3.3k) - Task completion updater
- `specTaskReview.md` (1.2k) - Spec task reviewer
- `report_updates.md` (6.1k) - Report generator
- `specs2wiki.md` (0 bytes) - Empty file
- `langgraph-agents-builder.md` (4.0k) - LangGraph agent builder

**Agent Files in `/.claude/agents/`:**
- `code-minimalist-refactor.md`
- `unit-test-engineer.md`
- `session2notes-agent.md`

**Key Finding:** A `/prime` command already exists (3.6k)! Need to review its current implementation before modifying.

### 1.4: File Naming Conventions ✓

**Status:** DOCUMENTED - Mixed conventions identified

**Brainstorming Sessions (0-brainstorming/):**
- Pattern 1: `session-N.md` (with hyphen) - e.g., session-1.md, session-2.md
- Pattern 2: `sessionN.md` (no hyphen) - e.g., session2.md, session3.md, session4.md
- **Recommendation:** Standardize on `session-N.md` (with hyphen) for consistency

**PRD Documents (1-prds/):**
- Pattern: `prdN.md` (no hyphen, no dash) - e.g., prd2.md, prd3.md
- **Current:** Consistent within directory

**Specification Documents (2-specs/):**
- Pattern: `specs-N.md` (with hyphen) - e.g., specs-1.md, specs-2.md, specs-4.md
- Variants: `specsN.md` and `specsN-simplified.md` also present
- **Current:** Mostly consistent with hyphen

**Naming Convention Summary:**
```
Brainstorming:  session-N.md OR sessionN.md (INCONSISTENT)
PRD:            prdN.md (CONSISTENT)
Specs:          specs-N.md (MOSTLY CONSISTENT)
```

### 1.5: Missing Directories ✓

**Status:** IDENTIFIED - Three directories need creation (UPDATED IN TASK 2.0)

**Missing Directories Required for Specs-4:**
1. ~~`3-user-stories/`~~ → `2-user-stories/` - For user story documents (Layer 2 = Planning)
2. ~~`6-acceptance-criteria/`~~ → `2-validation/` - For validation documents (Layer 2 = Planning)
3. ~~`7-diagrams/`~~ → `2-diagrams/` - For Mermaid diagram files (Layer 2 = Planning)

**Rationale for Change:** All planning documents should be grouped in Layer 2 for logical organization.

## Observations and Recommendations

### Positive Findings
1. ✓ Core infrastructure is well-established
2. ✓ Essential prompt templates exist
3. ✓ Command system is extensive and active
4. ✓ `/prime` command already exists (may just need enhancement)

### Areas for Attention
1. **Naming Inconsistency:** Brainstorming sessions use mixed naming conventions
2. **Directory Numbering:** Multiple directories share the same prefix numbers (2-, 4-, 5-)
3. **Existing Prime Command:** Review current implementation before modifications
4. **Legacy Directories:** Some directories (2-prds, 0-meetings) may be legacy or experimental

### Impact on Implementation

**Simplified Scope:**
- `/prime` command exists - Task 9-11 may be ENHANCEMENT rather than new implementation
- Need to review current `/prime` functionality before modifying
- May preserve existing features while adding session context loading

**Standard Scope:**
- Task 2.0: Create three missing directories
- Task 4-6: Create new prompt files for stories, validation, graph
- Task 7-8: Create new command files and master plan orchestrator
- Task 12-14: Testing and documentation

## Next Steps

**Immediate (Task 2.0):** ✓ COMPLETED
1. ✓ Created `ai-docs/2-user-stories/` directory (revised from 3-user-stories)
2. ✓ Created `ai-docs/2-validation/` directory (revised from 6-acceptance-criteria)
3. ✓ Created `ai-docs/2-diagrams/` directory (revised from 7-diagrams)

**Directory Organization Philosophy:**
- **Layer 0:** Source material (brainstorming, meetings, emails)
- **Layer 1:** Product requirements (PRDs)
- **Layer 2:** Planning documents (specs, user stories, validation, diagrams)
- **Layer 4:** Reusable prompts and templates
- **Layer 5:** Workflow definitions

**Before Task 9 (Prime Command):**
1. Read and analyze existing `.claude/commands/prime.md`
2. Determine what functionality already exists
3. Plan enhancement strategy rather than reimplementation

**General:**
1. Consider file naming standardization as optional Task 15.0
2. Document legacy directory purposes if unclear
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing patterns

## Conclusion

Infrastructure audit successfully completed. The project has a solid foundation with most required components in place. Three new directories need creation, and several new prompt/command files need implementation. The discovery of an existing `/prime` command is valuable and may reduce implementation scope for Tasks 9-11.

All findings documented in specs-4.md with tasks marked complete.
