# C# Legacy Codebase Documentation System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development of an automated multi-agent documentation system designed to comprehensively document large legacy C# codebases using local LLMs. The system addresses the challenge of documenting extensive codebases that exceed the context window of smaller, local language models by implementing a hierarchical, incremental documentation approach. The solution employs a layered pipeline of specialized AI agents that work together to directly analyze code, infer structure and relationships, generate documentation at multiple levels of detail, and ensure quality through validation loops.

The system uses LLM agents to directly infer hierarchy, dependencies, and architectural patterns from source code without relying on external AST parsers. This LLM-native approach simplifies the architecture while leveraging the semantic understanding capabilities of modern language models to produce high-quality, context-aware documentation.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
Organizations maintain large legacy C# codebases (potentially tens of thousands of files) with incomplete or absent documentation. Manual documentation efforts are prohibitively time-consuming, error-prone, and often become outdated as code evolves. Existing automated documentation tools provide shallow, syntax-level documentation without capturing semantic meaning, architectural relationships, or business context.

When attempting to use AI for documentation generation, teams face several critical challenges:
- **Context window limitations**: Local LLMs cannot process entire large codebases in a single prompt
- **Resource constraints**: Smaller, local models lack the power of cloud-based alternatives but are preferred for security, cost, and privacy reasons
- **Lack of hierarchy awareness**: Simple file-by-file approaches miss architectural relationships and fail to prioritize critical components
- **Quality inconsistency**: Single-pass generation produces documentation of varying quality without validation or refinement

### Desired State
Development teams have access to comprehensive, accurate, multi-layered documentation for their C# codebases that captures:
- High-level file and module summaries
- Detailed function and class-level documentation with docstrings
- Cross-file dependency mappings and architectural relationships
- Validated, refined documentation that meets quality standards

The documentation generation process should:
- Work incrementally with local, smaller LLMs
- Follow a hierarchical strategy to maximize value delivery
- Provide quality assurance through validation loops
- Scale to codebases of any size through modular architecture

### Value Proposition
This solution delivers significant business value by:
1. **Accelerating onboarding**: New developers can understand legacy codebases 10x faster with comprehensive documentation
2. **Reducing maintenance costs**: Clear documentation reduces debugging time and prevents knowledge loss
3. **Enabling modernization**: Well-documented legacy code is easier to refactor, migrate, or replace
4. **Maintaining privacy**: Local LLM execution keeps proprietary code on-premises
5. **Ensuring sustainability**: Automated documentation can be regenerated as code evolves
