# FAQ[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/faq/#faq "Permanent link")
Common questions and their answers!
## Do I need to use LangChain to use LangGraph? What’s the difference?[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/faq/#do-i-need-to-use-langchain-to-use-langgraph-whats-the-difference "Permanent link")
No. LangGraph is an orchestration framework for complex agentic systems and is more low-level and controllable than LangChain agents. LangChain provides a standard interface to interact with models and other components, useful for straight-forward chains and retrieval flows.
## How is LangGraph different from other agent frameworks?[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/faq/#how-is-langgraph-different-from-other-agent-frameworks "Permanent link")
Other agentic frameworks can work for simple, generic tasks but fall short for complex tasks bespoke to a company’s needs. LangGraph provides a more expressive framework to handle companies’ unique tasks without restricting users to a single black-box cognitive architecture.
## Does LangGraph impact the performance of my app?[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/faq/#does-langgraph-impact-the-performance-of-my-app "Permanent link")
LangGraph will not add any overhead to your code and is specifically designed with streaming workflows in mind.
## Is LangGraph open source? Is it free?[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/faq/#is-langgraph-open-source-is-it-free "Permanent link")
Yes. LangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library and is free to use.
## How are LangGraph and LangGraph Platform different?[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/faq/#how-are-langgraph-and-langgraph-platform-different "Permanent link")
LangGraph is a stateful, orchestration framework that brings added control to agent workflows. LangGraph Platform is a service for deploying and scaling LangGraph applications, with an opinionated API for building agent UXs, plus an integrated developer studio.
Features | LangGraph (open source) | LangGraph Platform  
---|---|---  
Description | Stateful orchestration framework for agentic applications | Scalable infrastructure for deploying LangGraph applications  
SDKs | Python and JavaScript | Python and JavaScript  
HTTP APIs | None | Yes - useful for retrieving & updating state or long-term memory, or creating a configurable assistant  
Streaming | Basic | Dedicated mode for token-by-token messages  
Checkpointer | Community contributed | Supported out-of-the-box  
Persistence Layer | Self-managed | Managed Postgres with efficient storage  
Deployment | Self-managed | • Cloud SaaS   
• Free self-hosted   
• Enterprise (paid self-hosted)  
Scalability | Self-managed | Auto-scaling of task queues and servers  
Fault-tolerance | Self-managed | Automated retries  
Concurrency Control | Simple threading | Supports double-texting  
Scheduling | None | Cron scheduling  
Monitoring | None | Integrated with LangSmith for observability  
IDE integration | LangGraph Studio | LangGraph Studio  
## Is LangGraph Platform open source?[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/faq/#is-langgraph-platform-open-source "Permanent link")
No. LangGraph Platform is proprietary software.
There is a free, self-hosted version of LangGraph Platform with access to basic features. The Cloud SaaS deployment option is free while in beta, but will eventually be a paid service. We will always give ample notice before charging for a service and reward our early adopters with preferential pricing. The Self-Hosted deployment options are paid services. [Contact our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) to learn more.
For more information, see our [LangGraph Platform pricing page](https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langgraph-platform).
## Does LangGraph work with LLMs that don't support tool calling?[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/faq/#does-langgraph-work-with-llms-that-dont-support-tool-calling "Permanent link")
Yes! You can use LangGraph with any LLMs. The main reason we use LLMs that support tool calling is that this is often the most convenient way to have the LLM make its decision about what to do. If your LLM does not support tool calling, you can still use it - you just need to write a bit of logic to convert the raw LLM string response to a decision about what to do.
## Does LangGraph work with OSS LLMs?[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/faq/#does-langgraph-work-with-oss-llms "Permanent link")
Yes! LangGraph is totally ambivalent to what LLMs are used under the hood. The main reason we use closed LLMs in most of the tutorials is that they seamlessly support tool calling, while OSS LLMs often don't. But tool calling is not necessary (see [this section](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/faq/#does-langgraph-work-with-llms-that-dont-support-tool-calling)) so you can totally use LangGraph with OSS LLMs.
## Can I use LangGraph Studio without logging to LangSmith[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/faq/#can-i-use-langgraph-studio-without-logging-to-langsmith "Permanent link")
Yes! You can use the [development version of LangGraph Server](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/langgraph-platform/local-server/) to run the backend locally. This will connect to the studio frontend hosted as part of LangSmith. If you set an environment variable of `LANGSMITH_TRACING=false` then no traces will be sent to LangSmith.
