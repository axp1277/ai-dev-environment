# Overview
## Components[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_components/#components "Permanent link")
The LangGraph Platform consists of components that work together to support the development, deployment, debugging, and monitoring of LangGraph applications:
  * [LangGraph Server](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_server/): The server defines an opinionated API and architecture that incorporates best practices for deploying agentic applications, allowing you to focus on building your agent logic rather than developing server infrastructure.
  * [LangGraph CLI](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_cli/): LangGraph CLI is a command-line interface that helps to interact with a local LangGraph
  * [LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/): LangGraph Studio is a specialized IDE that can connect to a LangGraph Server to enable visualization, interaction, and debugging of the application locally.
  * [Python/JS SDK](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/sdk/): The Python/JS SDK provides a programmatic way to interact with deployed LangGraph Applications.
  * [Remote Graph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/use-remote-graph/): A RemoteGraph allows you to interact with any deployed LangGraph application as though it were running locally.
  * [LangGraph control plane](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_control_plane/): The LangGraph Control Plane refers to the Control Plane UI where users create and update LangGraph Servers and the Control Plane APIs that support the UI experience.
  * [LangGraph data plane](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_data_plane/): The LangGraph Data Plane refers to LangGraph Servers, the corresponding infrastructure for each server, and the "listener" application that continuously polls for updates from the LangGraph Control Plane.
