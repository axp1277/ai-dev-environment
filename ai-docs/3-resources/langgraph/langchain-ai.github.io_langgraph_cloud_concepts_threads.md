# Threads[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/concepts/threads/#threads "Permanent link")
A thread contains the accumulated state of a sequence of [runs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/concepts/runs/). If a run is executed on a thread, then the [state](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#state) of the underlying graph of the assistant will be persisted to the thread.
A thread's current and historical state can be retrieved. To persist state, a thread must be created prior to executing a run.
The state of a thread at a particular point in time is called a [checkpoint](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/#checkpoints). Checkpoints can be used to restore the state of a thread at a later time.
For more on threads and checkpoints, see this section of the [LangGraph conceptual guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/).
The LangGraph Cloud API provides several endpoints for creating and managing threads and thread state. See the [API reference](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/api/api_ref.html#tag/threads) for more details.
