# Breakpoints[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/breakpoints/#breakpoints "Permanent link")
Breakpoints pause graph execution at defined points and let you step through each stage. They use LangGraph's [**persistence layer**](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/), which saves the graph state after each step.
With breakpoints, you can inspect the graph's state and node inputs at any point. Execution pauses **indefinitely** until you resume, as the checkpointer preserves the state.
