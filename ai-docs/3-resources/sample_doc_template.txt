One paragraph description of the module.

5.x.x.x.1 Dependencies

Bulleted list of dependencies as defined in the *.csproj file where the "ProjectReference" tag defines the required dependencies. Include one sentence description of why the dependency is referenced.

5.x.x.x.2 Classes

One subsection for each view which consists of two files. A view consists of two files both of which should be grouped into a single subsection. The first file is a *.xaml file which defines the layout of the view based on the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The second file is a *.xaml.cs file which defines code required to make the view work. Include a list of controls and a one sentence description of each control.
One subsection for each class that is not part of a view. The classes are contained in the *.cs files. A *.cs file may have a combination of one or more classes, interfaces, enumerations, structs.

Both types of subsections should be structured as follows:

5.x.x.x.2.x Class/View/Interface/Enum/Struct Name

A single line indicating the namespace of the class/view/interface/struct.
    if the class or interface is derived or an extension of another class or interface, list the classes and interfaces that were derived and/or extended. 

One paragraph description of the class/view/interface/enum/struct'.

Bulleted list of attributes/variables including data type and whether it is public or private followed by a one sentence description of what each attribute/variable is used for.

Bulleted list of properties including data type followed by a one sentence description of what each property is used for. If the property contains more complex logic, a longer description is acceptable.

Bulleted list of methods starting with the full signature of the method followed by a one paragraph decription of what the method does. Ensure to include constructors as methods.
