# Playbooks & Helpers

The `playbooks/` directory contains assistant-agnostic runbooks for common operations:
- Prompts are referenced from `ai-docs/4-prompts/`.
- Agent role definitions live in `agents/`.
- Each playbook lists required inputs, execution steps, and expected outputs.

Use these documents as checklists for any AI coding assistant or for manual execution. They replace the platform-specific slash commands that previously lived in `.claude/commands/`.
