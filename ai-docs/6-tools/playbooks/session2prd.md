# Playbook: Brainstorming Session â†’ Product Requirements Document

## Purpose
Transform a brainstorming session transcript into a PRD that captures the business context, requirements, and success metrics discussed during the session.

## Inputs
- `ai-docs/0-brainstorming/session<session_number>.md`
- Prompt reference: `ai-docs/4-prompts/session-to-prd.md`

## Steps
1. Open the relevant session file (`session<session_number>.md` or `session-<session_number>.md`).
2. Review the session-to-PRD prompt to align on structure, tone, and required sections.
3. Extract the session's business objectives, user personas, functional scope, constraints, and risks.
4. Draft the PRD using the template below, tying each section back to explicit statements in the transcript.
5. Save the finished document to `ai-docs/1-prds/prd<session_number>.md`.
6. Verify all sections are complete and the Source Session metadata references the correct file.
