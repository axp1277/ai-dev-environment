# ai-docs Universal Scaffold

The repository standardises how AI-assisted software projects store brainstorming transcripts, prompts, workflows, and delivery artifacts. With a predictable `ai-docs/` layout any coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot CLI, etc.) can load the context and work productively without custom setup.

### Prompts (`ai-docs/1-prompts/`)
- **Core** prompts capture source-to-output conversions such as brain2specs, session-to-prd, meeting transcripts to minutes, and coding standards.
- **Roles** store assistant personas (formerly under `agents/`) so any model can adopt the right behaviour before executing a task.
- **Utilities** house operational prompts: updating spec status, generating reports, running git commits, bootstrapping projects, etc.

### Workflows (`ai-docs/2-workflows/`)
Workflow files orchestrate multiple prompts. `workflow1.md` shows the complete session pipeline (brainstorm â†’ spec â†’ simplification â†’ PRD). `workflow-conventions.md` and `workflow-guidelines.md` explain how to author new workflows in a platform-neutral format.

### Delivery Artifacts
- `3-specs/` keeps implementation-ready specifications with task emojis.
- `4-prds/` stores product requirements distilled from the same sessions.
- `5-meeting-notes/` collects meeting minutes written via the transcript-to-minutes prompt.

## Getting Started

1. Capture a brainstorming session in `ai-docs/0-brainstorming/session<id>.md`.
2. Convert the session into documentation:
   - Run the spec conversion with `ai-docs/1-prompts/core/brain2specs.md` (output to `ai-docs/3-specs/`).
   - Run the PRD conversion with `ai-docs/1-prompts/core/session-to-prd.md` (output to `ai-docs/4-prds/`).
   - Use `ai-docs/2-workflows/workflow1.md` when you want the pipeline executed end to end, including the simplification step.
3. Maintain specs by updating task glyphs via `ai-docs/1-prompts/utilities/update_completion.md` and logging progress notes as needed.
4. For scope control, brief the assistant with `ai-docs/1-prompts/roles/spec-simplification-agent.md` before reviewing a spec.

## Creating New Prompts or Workflows

- Place any new conversion or system prompt under `ai-docs/1-prompts/core/`.
- Store new assistant personas in `ai-docs/1-prompts/roles/` with usage examples.
- Add operational checklists or maintenance routines to `ai-docs/1-prompts/utilities/`.
- When tasks require sequencing multiple prompts, draft a workflow in `ai-docs/2-workflows/` following the conventions file.

## Maintaining the Knowledge Base

- Commit generated specs, PRDs, and meeting notes alongside code so history remains traceable.
- Keep emoji statuses in specs current (â­•/ðŸ”„/âœ…) using the update utility prompt.
- Produce `assistant-context.md` files for complex code areas via `ai-docs/1-prompts/utilities/prime.md` so future assistants ramp quickly.
- Use `ai-docs/6-resources/` for reference material that does not fit prompts or workflows.

With the centralised prompts directory and dedicated workflows, any assistant or teammate can locate the right instructions instantly and follow repeatable processes across projects.
